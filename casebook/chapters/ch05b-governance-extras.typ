  summary: [
    The UK Post Office's Horizon accounting system, built by Fujitsu and
    rolled out in 1999, generated phantom shortfalls in sub-postmasters'
    branch ledgers. Rather than accept the software was at fault, the Post
    Office prosecuted them — around 900 over two decades — for theft and
    false accounting; people were imprisoned, bankrupted, and driven to
    suicide, in what is now called the most widespread miscarriage of
    justice in UK history. Internal documents showed engineers had known
    about Horizon bugs throughout. Convictions began to be quashed in 2021,
    and a public inquiry continues. The failure ran through the prosecutor
    and the courts: each accepted "the computer said so" as authoritative
    because no actor had the standing or expertise to challenge it. Horizon
    is the book's case for institutional deference to a flawed algorithm.

    // -- Background --
    [
      The UK Post Office ran thousands of branches through sub-postmasters —
      local operators personally liable for any shortfall in their accounts,
      a liability that put each operator's livelihood behind the numbers the
      system reported. In 1999 it deployed Horizon, an accounting system built
      by Fujitsu, to track every branch's ledger, making the software the
      single authority on whether a branch's books balanced.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      Horizon produced systematic accounting errors — phantom shortfalls that
      appeared in branch ledgers where no money was actually missing. The Post
      Office treated the shortfalls as real and the sub-postmasters as thieves:
      over two decades it prosecuted around 900 for theft and false
      accounting, refusing to accept the system itself was at fault even as
      the same pattern recurred branch after branch. People were imprisoned,
      lost homes, went bankrupt, and some died by suicide — the human cost of
      trusting the ledger over the person.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      Documents later released through litigation showed Fujitsu and Post
      Office engineers had known about Horizon bugs throughout the period —
      the knowledge of fallibility existed inside the institution even as it
      prosecuted people for the system's errors.#cn() The courts began
      quashing convictions in 2021, and the public inquiry under Sir Wyn
      Williams found that senior employees "knew, or at the very least should
      have known, that Legacy Horizon was capable of error" — establishing it
      as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history, sustained
      precisely because that internal knowledge never reached the people on
      trial.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The gap was at the regulator, the prosecutor, and the courts: each
      accepted Fujitsu's representation that Horizon was reliable, despite
      documentation to the contrary, because no institutional actor had the
      standing or expertise to interrogate it, so the claim of reliability
      passed unchallenged through every layer that could have tested it. "The
      computer said so" became, for two decades, a sufficient basis for
      criminal conviction — the governance hazard of treating automated output
      as authoritative rather than as evidence to be challenged, with a
      person's account on the other side of the scale.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      Convictions have been overturned — some by an exceptional act of
      Parliament, a measure of how far the ordinary appeal routes had failed —
      compensation schemes established, and Fujitsu and the Post Office called
      to account before the continuing inquiry.#cn() Horizon's lesson is the
      chapter's in its bluntest form: an automated system's output is not
      testimony, and any institution that lets "the computer said so" stand
      unchallenged against a human's account has built a machine for
      manufacturing injustice, one that runs for as long as no one is
      empowered to switch it off.

      Theranos claimed to have built a blood-testing platform — the "Edison"

      diagnostics industry built on venous draws and large analyzers. It rode

      The device did not work. Internal data showed accuracy far below what
      the company represented to investors, partners, and patients — the gap
      between the claim and the instrument was known inside the company. To
      preserve the appearance of a working product, Theranos ran most patient
      samples on conventional commercial analyzers and reported the results

      The fraud exploited a regulatory seam: the FDA had not validated the
      device, while the CLIA regime that governs laboratory operation did not
      match the architecture of the company's product claims, and neither
      layer validated those claims independently — so the device fell into a
      gap each regulator assumed the other covered. The board, the investors,
      and Walgreens lacked the technical depth to challenge them, and a
      celebrity board offered prestige in place of scrutiny; the journalist
      John Carreyrou, and CMS inspectors who revoked Theranos's CLIA
      certificate in 2016, were what finally surfaced the truth from outside
      the failed oversight chain.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The capability gap sat in the regulatory architecture — at the boundary
      between two regimes, where a deliberate fraud could live because
      neither the FDA nor CLIA owned end-to-end validation of a novel
      diagnostic making clinical claims, and an unowned boundary is exactly
      the shelter a fraud needs. The governance lesson is that the seam
      between regulators is itself a place that must be engineered, because it
      is exactly where a bad actor will operate — choosing the gap precisely
      because no one is watching it.#cn()

      The case is canonical in business education for fraud-as-product-strategy
      and in health regulation for the gap that let unvalidated clinical
      tests reach patients — a reminder that "disruptive" claims in a

      The exploitable gap was at the regulator's instrument: the emissions
      test ran in a regime the vehicle could detect, so a manufacturer
      determined to evade could tune its behavior to the test rather than to
      the road, optimizing for the measurement instead of the goal it stood
      for. Dieselgate is the canonical case of institutionally engineered
      evasion of a measurement system — and a reminder that any test the
      measured party can recognize is a test it can defeat, because a
      detectable test invites the very gaming it is meant to catch.#cn()

      The reform closed the gap at the instrument: the EU introduced
      real-world driving-emissions testing, moving the measurement off the
      predictable bench and onto the road the standard actually cared about,
      making it far harder to game.#cn() The pattern parallels Takata (Case
      52) — a manufacturer's fraud meeting a regulator whose evidence pipeline
      trusted the manufacturer's test conditions, and a fix that had to
      upgrade the measurement itself, not just punish the cheat, because
      punishing the cheat leaves the exploitable instrument in place for the
      next one.

      researcher, was found answerable for what its design permitted.#cn() The
      platform's API had never been red-teamed against systematic data
      extraction; its contract simply assumed developers would behave, a trust

      are benevolent") that no one had stress-tested against a determined
      abuser, an assumption holding up the whole permission model without ever
      being named as one. On a platform at societal scale, an unexamined
      assumption about how an interface will be used is itself a capability
      deliverable — and an unexamined one is a latent failure waiting for the

    connection. The structural engineer's office approved the change without

      The Kansas City Hyatt Regency's atrium featured walkways suspended from
      the ceiling, carrying crowds above an open public space where any

      design hung them from single continuous steel rods, a configuration in
      which each rod carried one walkway's load to the structure above.#cn()

    // -- What Happened --
    [
      During construction the connection was changed — for ease of assembly,
      to avoid threading a single long rod through both walkways — to a
      two-rod arrangement that effectively doubled the load on the upper
      walkway's connection, and the structural engineer's office approved the
      change without recalculating it, treating an assembly convenience as if
      it carried no structural consequence. On 17 July 1981, during a crowded
      tea dance, the overstressed connection let go; two walkways fell onto
      the atrium floor, killing 114 people and injuring 216 — at the time the
      deadliest structural collapse in U.S. history.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The National Bureau of Standards found the as-built connection carried
      roughly twice its intended load and had been inadequate even under the
      building code's requirements — so the original single-rod design had
      itself been marginal, and the field change pushed an already-thin
      connection past failure.#cn() The Missouri licensing board revoked the
      licenses of the responsible engineers, fixing accountability on the
      engineer of record, and the case became the foundational
      engineering-ethics example taught to undergraduates: how a small
      construction change, accepted casually, can turn a design that works
      into one that fails.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The capability gap was at the institutional review of construction
      changes. Nothing required a change to a load-bearing connection detail
      to be re-analyzed by the engineer of record before it was built — so a
      modification that doubled a critical load passed through the system
      without anyone computing what it did, the absence of a required check
      letting a fatal change look like a routine one. The missing capability
      was change control with the engineer's calculation in the loop, a gate
      that re-derives the consequence before the field accepts the change.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The collapse reshaped how the profession treats shop-drawing review and
      the engineer of record's responsibility for connection design,
      hardening into rule the accountability the failure had exposed, and it
      anchored modern engineering-ethics teaching.#cn() Its lesson
      generalizes well beyond steel: a change that looks trivial at the point
      of assembly can be catastrophic at the point of load, and the only
      defense is a review that re-derives the consequence rather than
      trusting that "it's a small change" — because triviality at assembly is
      no guarantee of triviality under load.

    // -- Background --
    [
      The FIU-Sweetwater pedestrian bridge over Southwest Eighth Street in
      Miami was a modern, computationally designed concrete truss, built to
      be assembled beside the road and lifted into place — engineered with
      tools more capable than any prior era's, the kind of software that lets
      a designer model a structure in detail no slide rule ever could. That
      sophistication framed the bridge as a showcase of modern method.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      It collapsed during construction on 15 March 2018, dropping onto the
      road and the cars stopped beneath it, killing six — the failure landing
      on the very traffic the bridge would one day span. The NTSB found the
      design firm had made calculation errors at a critical truss connection —
      underestimating the load demand and overestimating the capacity, an
      error in both directions at once — and that the independent peer review,
      the safeguard meant to catch exactly such mistakes, had not caught
      them.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The warnings were there. Large cracks had appeared at that connection
      in the days before, were inspected, and were judged not to threaten
      safety — a judgment reaffirmed in a meeting the morning of the collapse,
      even as workers operated on the span and traffic ran underneath, so the
      structure was failing visibly while being declared safe.#cn() The errors
      that produced the collapse were the timeless ones: a load case
      inadequately considered, a review that did not catch the gap, and
      visible distress rationalized as not safety-critical — each a failure
      mode older than the software that drew the bridge.#cn()

    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      FIU is the contemporary reminder that more capable design tools do not
      retire the old failure modes. The bridge was designed with
      sophisticated software, yet failed for the same reasons structures have
      failed for a century — because the human and institutional capabilities
      around the tools (independent review that re-derives the answer, a rule
      that visible cracking on a critical member stops work) had not kept
      pace with the software's sophistication, leaving the newest tools
      guarded by the oldest, weakest procedures.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The NTSB faulted the design firm, the peer reviewer, and the parties
      who kept the road open beneath a cracking structure — spreading the
      responsibility across every layer that could have intervened — and the
      case sharpened scrutiny of accelerated-bridge-construction methods and
      independent design review.#cn() Its lesson pairs with the Hyatt Regency
      (Case 74) across forty years: the computer drew a better bridge, but
      the governance of the calculation — who checks it, and what a crack is
      allowed to mean — is still where safety lives, unchanged by four decades
      of better software.
