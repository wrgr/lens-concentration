  summary: [
    On 3 July 1988, during a surface skirmish with Iranian gunboats in the
    Persian Gulf, the USS Vincennes shot down Iran Air Flight 655 — a
    civilian Airbus A300 climbing on a scheduled route — killing all 290
    aboard, the deadliest airliner shootdown by a military force. The Aegis
    combat system worked: its radar correctly showed the aircraft ascending.
    Yet operators in the Combat Information Center, primed to expect a
    hostile attack, read the contact as a descending F-14 and fired. The
    Navy's inquiry attributed the tragedy to human error under extreme
    stress — confirmation bias and the unconscious distortion of data — not
    equipment failure. Vincennes is the book's foundational human-AI-teaming
    case: the most advanced system afloat failed because its interface did
    not support correct performance under combat stress.

    // -- Background --
    [
      In the closing weeks of the Iran-Iraq War, U.S. warships patrolled a
      tense Persian Gulf where civilian airliners and hostile military
      aircraft shared the same crowded sky. The USS Vincennes, a cruiser
      with the Navy's most advanced Aegis combat system, was in a surface
      fight with Iranian gunboats when an aircraft took off from a nearby
      airfield used by both civil and military traffic.#cn() The dual-use
      field meant a single track could be either threat or scheduled flight,
      so the crew's reading of the contact carried the whole burden of
      identification — and they were already maneuvering hard against the
      gunboats, the kind of divided attention under which a wrong call
      becomes far easier to make than a right one.
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      The aircraft was Iran Air Flight 655, a civilian Airbus A300 climbing
      on its scheduled route. The Vincennes' crew identified it as a
      descending, hostile F-14 and fired two surface-to-air missiles; all 290
      people aboard were killed — the deadliest shootdown of a commercial
      airliner by a military force.#cn() An ascending airliner and a diving
      attack jet are opposite behaviors, yet the crew converged on the second
      while the radar reported the first; the engagement consumed only minutes,
      collapsing identification, decision, and launch into a window too narrow
      for anyone to slow down and reconcile the contradiction.
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The Aegis system had not malfunctioned: its radar correctly showed the
      aircraft ascending. Yet several crew members in the Combat Information
      Center independently believed it was descending,#cn() a shared error
      that is more damning than a single misread, because it shows the
      interface offered no cross-check strong enough to break a wrong reading
      once the team had settled into it. The Navy's
      Fogarty inquiry attributed the tragedy to human error under extreme
      stress — to confirmation bias and the "stress and unconscious
      distortion of data" — as operators read every indication through the
      lens of a presumed hostile attack, because the framing arrived before
      the data did, so each new return was fitted to the expected threat
      rather than weighed against it.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The system did not lie, and the operators did not act in bad faith. The
      interface and the operational framing combined to make a particular
      misreading not merely possible but likely. Correct performance was
      possible in principle and unsustainable in practice — and the gap
      between those two is the engineering problem. An interface that
      presents data without guarding against the crew's pre-formed
      expectation has not been designed for the stress it will actually
      meet; the burden of overriding a presumed hostile attack was left
      entirely to the operator's discipline, exactly when combat had stripped
      that discipline of the time and calm it needed to work.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      Decades later the case became a central reference in the
      human-AI-teaming conversation: a 2018 Naval Institute retrospective placed it at
      the heart of how operators should be teamed with automated decision
      aids under stress.#cn() Its lesson is that interface design is a
      capability deliverable, not an aesthetic one — and that the most
      advanced system afloat is only as good as the human reading it under
      fire. The retrospective reframed the loss not as a one-off error but as
      a predictable outcome of teaming a person with a decision aid that
      displayed truth without defending it, a pattern that recurs wherever
      automation is fast and the human is the last check.

  summary: [
    The 2009 HITECH Act poured roughly \$30 billion into accelerating
    electronic health records, and adoption surged — but the systems had
    been built to billing and administrative specifications, not clinical
    workflow. New categories of harm followed. A disputed but canonical 2005

    pediatric ICU was associated with a near-doubling of mortality; later
    deployments showed mixed or improved results, yet the warning stuck. A
    2023 survey across 200-plus hospitals found EHR usability is clinicians'
    top complaint, and that usability scores track patient-safety outcomes.
    Specific harms recur — a missed abnormal result hidden behind a default,

      The 2009 HITECH Act authorized roughly \$30 billion in incentives to
      accelerate electronic health record adoption, and adoption surged. But
      the systems clinicians now had to use had been built to administrative
      and billing specifications, not to clinical workflow or human-factors
      specifications — a mismatch baked in before the first order was
      entered.#cn() Because the incentives rewarded adoption rather than
      usability, hospitals raced to install whatever cleared the bar, and the
      specification gap propagated to the bedside at national scale before
      anyone had to demonstrate that the tools supported the work of care
      rather than merely the work of billing.

      New categories of harm appeared alongside the new tools. A 2005 study
      reported that deploying a commercial computerized order-entry (CPOE)
      system at one pediatric ICU was associated with a near-doubling of
      mortality — a single-institution result that provoked debate and that
      later deployments elsewhere did not reproduce, but that became
      canonical as a warning that powerful tools without workflow integration
      can disrupt care at the moment of greatest acuity, when the seconds the
      interface adds to an order are the seconds a critical patient does not
      have.#cn() Specific harms
      recur: a cancer treatment delayed for years because a default surfaced
      an old normal result instead of a recent abnormal one; a baby killed by
      an overdose an alert would have caught had it been switched on — each a
      case where the interface's defaults and toggles, not the clinician's

      A 2023 KLAS Arch Collaborative survey across more than two hundred
      hospitals found EHR usability is consistently the top complaint of
      physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, and that end-user experience
      scores correlate with patient-safety outcomes — turning a stream of
      anecdotes into longitudinal evidence that usability is now itself a
      patient-safety variable. Spanning some two hundred hospitals, the survey
      converts what could be dismissed as one site's grievance into a
      reproducible signal, the kind of measurement that makes an interface
      problem legible as a safety problem rather than a satisfaction one.#cn()

      EHR/CPOE is the canonical ongoing case of an interface designed for one
      set of requirements and deployed against another. The systems work for
      billing and administration because that was the design constraint; they
      fail for clinical workflow because clinical workflow was not. Decades
      and tens of billions of dollars later, usability remains among the
      largest contributors to in-system harm in U.S. healthcare — a cost that

      buying the tool is not the same as engineering the capability: an

      cost no one is formally counting, and without a monitoring regime the
      harm stays diffuse — spread across millions of encounters, attributable
