  summary: [
    LIBOR — the London Interbank Offered Rate — was the benchmark
    interest rate referenced in roughly \$350 trillion of financial
    contracts, yet it was set each day not from observed transactions but
    from a small panel of banks' estimates of what they would pay to
    borrow. For about a decade, banks systematically shaded those
    estimates to favor their own derivatives positions; the coordination
    was later laid bare in subpoenaed trader-and-submitter messages. The
    capability gap was in the design of the benchmark itself: it asked for
    declarations, not observations, and the architecture invited gaming.
    Regulators levied more than \$9 billion in fines, and LIBOR was
    eventually replaced by SOFR, a rate built from actual transactions.
    The reform changed the unit of measurement, not just the rules.

    // -- Background --
    [
      LIBOR was the benchmark interest rate underlying an estimated \$350
      trillion in loans, mortgages, and derivatives worldwide. It was set
      daily by a panel of large banks, each submitting an estimate of the
      rate at which it could borrow — a self-reported figure rather than a
      record of any transaction that had actually occurred. Because the same
      banks that set the rate held derivatives whose value moved with it, the
      instrument asked the parties with the most to gain to supply the very
      numbers that would decide their gains.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      For roughly a decade from the early 2000s, traders at multiple banks
      asked their firms' rate submitters to shade the daily LIBOR figure
      up or down to benefit the banks' derivatives books. The requests
      were routine and documented in internal messages later subpoenaed by
      regulators — casual, repeated, and unconcealed, which is the signature
      of conduct the participants did not believe could be detected. During
      the 2008 crisis, some banks also lowballed submissions to appear
      healthier than they were, bending the rate to mask their own funding
      stress as well as to profit.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      Investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice, UK regulators, and
      others produced settlements with Barclays, UBS, Deutsche Bank, RBS,
      and others totaling more than \$9 billion. The UK Treasury
      commissioned the Wheatley Review, which concluded that the
      benchmark's reliance on subjective estimates rather than
      transactions was the structural flaw that made manipulation possible.
      The review located the fault in the instrument rather than only in the
      individuals who exploited it, treating the gaming as the predictable
      output of a design that left the door open.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The capability that was missing was the basic architectural choice
      to measure observations rather than declarations. A benchmark built
      on what banks said they would pay is gameable by anyone willing to
      misstate; a benchmark built on transactions that actually occurred
      is not. The gaming, once it began, was systematic rather than
      occasional — exactly what the design invited — and because the figure
      flowed into hundreds of trillions in contracts, a small shading of the
      submission moved enormous sums while leaving no trace in any executed
      trade.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      LIBOR was phased out and replaced by SOFR, the Secured Overnight
      Financing Rate, which is constructed from observed overnight
      Treasury repo transactions. The transition took roughly a decade and
      required coordination across regulators in multiple jurisdictions;
      the reform re-engineered the measurement at the architecture level
      rather than merely policing the old one. By anchoring the benchmark to
      trades that actually settle, the redesign removed the discretion that
      had been the lever for manipulation, rather than asking submitters to
      exercise that discretion more honestly.#cn()

    Journal-Constitution_ found that for several years educators across
    dozens of schools had systematically erased and corrected students'
    answers on state standardized tests. The cheating was organized —
    principals pressured teachers, staff held "erasure parties" after
    testing days — and the incentive system rewarded the gaming with
    bonuses and promotions. Around 180 educators were implicated, 35
    indicted, and 11 convicted under Georgia's racketeering statute. The

    // -- Background --
    [
      During the 2000s, Atlanta Public Schools under superintendent
      Beverly Hall was celebrated nationally for rapid gains on Georgia's
      high-stakes standardized tests. Bonuses, public recognition, and job
      security were tied directly to those scores, and the district
      administered and reported the very tests on which it was being
      judged. With the reward attached to the number and the number produced
      in-house, the people under pressure to improve the score also
      controlled the answer sheets that determined it.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      Over several years, educators at dozens of APS elementary and middle
      schools systematically changed students' answers after testing. The
      cheating was organized rather than incidental: principals pressured
      teachers to hit targets, and staff held after-hours "erasure
      parties" to correct answer sheets. Suspiciously high rates of
      wrong-to-right erasures flagged the pattern — a statistical fingerprint
      the gaming left behind precisely because correcting a wrong answer to a
      right one is far rarer, by chance, than the reverse.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      A 2009 _Atlanta Journal-Constitution_ analysis of erasure data,
      followed by the state's Office of Student Achievement and a
      Governor-ordered special investigation supported by the Georgia
      Bureau of Investigation, documented the scheme in a 2011 report.
      Roughly 180 educators were implicated; 35 were indicted and 11
      convicted under Georgia's RICO statute, the report finding the
      administration had emphasized results and praise "to the exclusion
      of integrity and ethics." That an investigation came from outside the
      district — a newspaper and state investigators, not the schools — is
      itself the mark of the missing independent check.#cn()

    // -- The Capability Gap --

      The capability gap was at the measurement architecture: the
      institution being measured also operated the instrument that
      measured it. High-stakes incentives without an independent audit are
      a textbook setup for Campbell's Law — the more a measure is used for
      decision-making, the more it will be corrupted. The students were
      not learning; the system was rewarding the appearance of learning, so
      the score rose while the underlying capability it was meant to certify
      went unmeasured and, for the children, unmet.#cn()

      measurement used for consequential decisions needs an audit
      independent of the institution being measured — is direct, but is
      still rarely implemented at scale, because the independent audit costs
      money and political will that the high score, once reported, makes

    [
      Bernard Madoff was a former NASDAQ chairman and a respected Wall
      Street figure whose investment arm reported remarkably steady
      returns for years. Those returns were entirely fictitious: client
      funds were never invested, and earlier investors were paid with
      later investors' money — a Ponzi scheme that eventually represented
      some \$65 billion in fabricated account value. The very steadiness
      that reassured investors was the tell: real markets do not deliver an
      almost unbroken line of gains, and the absence of the normal volatility
      was itself evidence the numbers were manufactured.#cn()

      Fund is a Fraud." The SEC opened an investigation and concluded that
      no enforcement action was warranted. The warning was not a vague
      suspicion but a quantitative case any competent reviewer could in
      principle retrace, which is what makes the dismissal so telling. Madoff

      assigned to Madoff lacked the expertise to evaluate Markopolos's
      technical arguments, and the institutional culture had defaulted to
      treating Madoff as a respected industry figure rather than following
      the evidence. Stature stood in for analysis: the reviewers weighed who

      CIA, and NSA. The Commission famously concluded that "the most
      important failure was one of imagination" — a framing later
      criticized as understating the structural nature of the gap, which
      was less a lack of imagination than an absence of any institution
      responsible for integration. The distinction matters for the remedy: a
      failure of imagination invites exhortation to think harder, while a
      structural gap demands an institution be built to close it.#cn()

    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The intelligence sharing did not happen because no institution owned
      it as a deliverable. Each agency was competent inside its own
      boundary; the integration across boundaries existed nowhere as a
      required function. The missing capability was an architecture —
      shared watch-lists, mandated handoffs, a body responsible for fusing
      the picture — rather than more raw collection. The government did not
      lack data; it lacked the connective tissue to turn data held in many
      places into a single picture anyone was accountable for assembling.#cn()

    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 created
      the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National
      Counterterrorism Center, and fusion centers followed — the
      institutional architecture for cross-agency information sharing that
      had not previously existed. By creating bodies whose explicit mandate
      was integration, the reform converted information sharing from an act
      of individual initiative into a required function someone owned. The
      case is foundational in U.S. national-security policy for treating
      cross-agency capability as an engineerable institutional deliverable.#cn()

  summary: [
    Merck's painkiller Vioxx (rofecoxib) was approved by the FDA in 1999
    and prescribed to millions. A 2000 trial, VIGOR, found a roughly
    five-fold higher rate of heart attacks in the Vioxx arm than in the
    comparison drug — a signal many read as a protective effect of the
    comparator rather than a cardiovascular risk of Vioxx. Not until the
    placebo-controlled APPROVe trial was halted in 2004 was the risk
    established and the drug withdrawn. For nearly four years, the
    disclosure architecture between Merck's internal data, FDA reviewers,
    and prescribers failed to surface the magnitude of the danger to a
    decision point; an FDA scientist estimated tens of thousands of excess
    cardiovascular events. The reforms that followed — REMS and the
    Sentinel Initiative — built post-market surveillance that had not
    existed.

  sections: (
    // -- Background --
    [
      Vioxx, a COX-2 inhibitor for arthritis pain, was approved by the FDA
      in 1999 and became one of the most widely prescribed drugs of its
      era. Detecting rare or delayed harms in a drug at that scale depends
      on post-market surveillance — aggregating adverse-event data after
      approval — a function that, at the time, was thin relative to the
      size of the exposed population. A risk too small to surface in a
      pre-approval trial becomes a large absolute toll once a drug reaches
      millions, which is precisely the regime that demands strong
      after-market monitoring.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      The VIGOR trial, published in 2000, reported about a five-fold
      higher rate of myocardial infarction in patients taking Vioxx than
      in those taking naproxen. Merck and many readers interpreted the gap
      as naproxen being protective rather than Vioxx being harmful. That
      reading was not absurd — it was the more comfortable of two
      explanations for the same numbers — but it required the absent
      placebo arm to be true, and the data could not adjudicate between
      them. The placebo-controlled APPROVe trial, terminated in September
      2004, established the cardiovascular risk directly, and Merck withdrew
      the drug.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      Congressional hearings and subsequent analysis found that signals of
      cardiovascular harm had been present in the trial record for years
      before withdrawal. FDA scientist David Graham testified that the
      risk had been visible well before 2004 and estimated tens of
      thousands of excess heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths; a 2005
      _Lancet_ analysis quantified the population-level harm. The harm was
      not hidden in some unmeasured corner — it sat in the trial record the
      whole time, waiting for an architecture that would carry it to a
      decision rather than leave it to interpretation.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The capability gap was in post-market surveillance: the disclosure
      architecture between manufacturer-held data, FDA reviewers, and
      prescribers did not aggregate the signal to a decision boundary for
      nearly four years. The FDA's adverse-event reporting system relied on
      voluntary submissions structured to minimize signal, and was not
      adequate to the volume of the drug's distribution. A system that waits
      for a clinician to choose to file a report will always lag a harm
      spread thinly across millions of prescriptions, because no single
      prescriber sees enough of the pattern to recognize it.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      Merck eventually settled litigation for about \$4.85 billion. The
      case drove the creation of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies
      (REMS) and, in 2008, the FDA's Sentinel Initiative — an active
      post-market surveillance system that queries health-data partners
      rather than waiting for voluntary reports. By going out to the data
      instead of waiting for it to arrive, the reform inverted the logic that
      had let the signal sit unaggregated for years. The reform built the
      surveillance infrastructure that had not previously existed.#cn()
