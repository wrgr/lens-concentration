# Capability Matters — Per-Case Verification Log

> Working artifact for the per-case manual review of the v2.1 corpus (194 cases). One row per case, seven editor-guideline check columns + reviewer / date / notes. See **§ The rubric** below for what each check means, with tests and examples, and **§ Workflow** for how to review one case end-to-end.

---

## Status legend

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `—` | Not yet reviewed. |
| `✓` | Passed the check. Confident, no concerns. |
| `~` | Passed with a note. Defensible but worth flagging — write the note in the *notes* column. |
| `✗` | Issue found. Write what's wrong in *notes*; ping the editor before the case ships. |
| `?` | Outside your expertise — flag for an editor with relevant domain knowledge. |

If you're between `✓` and `~`, choose `~` and write the question. If you're between `~` and `✗`, choose `✗` and write what would change your mind. Better to over-flag than to miss something.

## How to review one case — two passes, 5–15 minutes

Each case gets two passes. The first is structural (Quality), the second is substantive (Content). Together they take 5–15 minutes for a clean case; longer when something needs investigation.

### Pass 1 — Quality (≈ 3–5 min) — scan first, mark four things

Skim the case once at reading pace. You're not yet checking facts; you're checking whether the case **looks right** in its own right.

| # | Check | The 30-second test |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **clarity** | After one read, can you write a one-sentence summary: *"This case is about how [actor] [did or failed to do] [thing], because [capability was missing or built]"*? If you can, `✓`. If you had to re-read, `~`. If you can't, `✗`. |
| 6 | **anchor fit** | Glance at the `lens-anchor` competency (D1–D5). Does what you just read match? Use the quick guide below. `✓` if yes, `~` if another would fit *better*, `✗` if it's wrong. |
| 7 | **x-refs** | Skim for "Case N" mentions in the prose. Are any obvious nonsense (Case 9999, or a number > 194)? `✓` if none, `✗` if any. (Detailed pairing check happens in Pass 2.) |

That's the structural pass. Three checks, ~3–5 minutes. Move on.

### Pass 2 — Content (≈ 5–10 min) — verify what the case *claims*

Now go reference-by-reference and claim-by-claim. This is where most issues live.

| # | Check | The test |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | **refs real** | For each reference in the `references:` list, find the source. Google Scholar → publisher / agency site → DOI.org → general search. Confirm author / year / title / venue match. `✓` if all clean, `~` if formatting off but findable, `✗` if any reference can't be found. |
| 3 | **refs support** | For each `#cn()` marker in the body, open the corresponding reference. Does it back the claim at that marker? `✓` if yes for all, `~` if mostly with one or two loose, `✗` if any marker is unsupported. |
| 4 | **conclusions reasonable** | Read the `le-insight:` and `lens-approach:` blocks. Does the case body and reference set support these conclusions? `✓` / `~` / `✗`. |
| 5 | **no overclaim** | Scan for quantitative claims (numbers, percentages, "halved", "doubled") and counterfactuals ("would have"). Are they sourced and hedged? `✓` / `~` / `✗`. |

That's the content pass. Four checks, ~5–10 minutes for a clean case.

### Worked example — Pass 1 + Pass 2 on Case 1 (USS Fitzgerald & USS John S. McCain)

> **Pass 1 — Quality** (3 min)
>
> *Read once.*
>
> - **clarity:** Sentence I can write: *"This case is about how the U.S. Navy declared two destroyers' crews ready for forward deployment, when their training had been cut and their watch teams couldn't safely run the watch — capability was hollowed out under operational tempo."* → `✓`
> - **anchor fit:** `lens-anchor: D1/PT1` (Systems Analysis, problem-type 1 = understanding the system). The case is about *engineered vs. stated readiness*. D1 fits. → `✓`
> - **x-refs:** Prose mentions Case 18 (Rickover Nuclear Navy) and Case 12 (Eagle Claw). Both real cases. → `✓`
>
> **Pass 2 — Content** (8 min)
>
> *Open references list.*
>
> - **refs real:** 5 references. Strategic Readiness Review 2017 (Navy.mil) ✓; NTSB MAR-19/01 ✓; GAO-21-179 ✓; Comprehensive Review (Adm. Davidson 2017) ✓; Tunbridge Report ✓. All findable, all real. → `✓`
> - **refs support:** Marker 1 cites Strategic Readiness Review — confirmed the report discusses the readiness gap. Markers 2–5 similar. → `✓`
> - **conclusions reasonable:** `le-insight` says "self-study did not replace the in-person school the Navy cut." The Strategic Readiness Review explicitly says this. → `✓`
> - **no overclaim:** "17 sailors killed" — sourced to NTSB. "About a decade of relentless tempo" — hedged ("about"). No counterfactual overreach. → `✓`
>
> **Total time: 11 minutes. Marks: all `✓`. Notes column: empty.**

## The rubric

### 1. clarity — *can a smart reader name what the case teaches in one sentence?*

**Pass test.** After reading the case once, write a one-sentence summary in your scratch notes: *"This case is about how [actor] [did / failed to do] [thing], because [capability was missing / built]."* If you can write the sentence confidently after one read, mark `✓`. If you had to re-read, mark `~` and note where the load-bearing fact was buried. If you can't write it even after two reads, mark `✗`.

**Common reasons to `✗`:**
- The load-bearing fact (the specific capability gap or intervention) is buried in the middle of a section and never named directly.
- Acronyms or jargon used without first defining them (e.g., "REMS" appearing five times before being expanded once).
- The "who did what when" is unclear — you can't tell whether the agency, the operator, or the regulator did the thing.

**Common reasons to `~`:**
- One paragraph is muddier than the others; case is otherwise clear.
- A specific term needs a parenthetical (e.g., "REMS — Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy") on first use.

### 2. refs real — *does every reference actually exist?*

**Pass test.** For each item in the case's `references:` list:
1. Find the source. Try **Google Scholar** (scholar.google.com), then the publisher / agency website (NTSB, FAA, FDA, IEEE, the journal's own page), then DOI.org for a DOI, then a regular web search.
2. Confirm the **author** / **year** / **title** / **venue** match what's printed in the case.

If all references check out, `✓`. If a reference has a small formatting issue but the source is clearly real (you found it), `~` with the correction in notes. If a reference can't be found at all after a reasonable search, `✗`.

**Common reasons to `✗`:**
- A DOI doesn't resolve and the title can't be found in any database.
- Author + year + venue combination doesn't return any hit.
- A "report" is cited without naming the agency or a report number, and you can't identify what report it is.

**Common reasons to `~`:**
- Title formatting is slightly off (e.g., title case vs sentence case) but the source is identifiable.
- Year is off by one and the right year exists.
- URL given is dead but the source can be found at a different URL.

**Tools.** Google Scholar; DOI.org; agency websites (FAA, NTSB, FDA, OSHA, etc.); arxiv.org for preprints; JSTOR / your library's proxy for paywalled academic; the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) for dead URLs.

### 3. refs support — *does each citation marker actually back its claim?*

**Pass test.** Find every `#cn()` marker in the case body. For each:
1. Read the sentence (or short passage) right before the marker.
2. Open the corresponding reference (the Nth `#cn()` corresponds to the Nth reference).
3. Does the reference contain the claim being marked, or close enough that the claim is a fair reading?

If every marker is well-supported, `✓`. If most are but one or two are loose, `~` with the marker numbers in notes. If a marker has no support in its reference, or the reference says something different, `✗`.

**Common reasons to `✗`:**
- The cited reference doesn't mention the specific fact at all.
- The cited reference says the *opposite* of what the case claims.
- The marker cites a reference that's about a different incident / agency / year.

**Common reasons to `~`:**
- The reference covers the general topic but the specific number / date / quote isn't in this source (it might be in a downstream source).
- The reference is a survey / summary that mentions the fact in passing; the original source isn't cited.

### 4. conclusions reasonable — *does the `le-insight` / `lens-approach` follow from the case body?*

**Pass test.** Re-read the `le-insight:` block and the `lens-approach:` block. Ask: *is this what the case body actually shows?*

If the conclusions are a fair reading of the case + references, `✓`. If the conclusion is defensible but stronger than the evidence warrants (could be hedged more), `~`. If the conclusion introduces a new fact not in the case body or references, or makes a leap the evidence doesn't support, `✗`.

**Common reasons to `✗`:**
- The lens-approach claims X "caused" Y when the case body shows only correlation.
- The le-insight introduces a fact that isn't in any reference.
- The conclusion attributes intent (e.g., "knowingly", "deliberately") without evidence.

**Common reasons to `~`:**
- Conclusion is fair but could be softened (e.g., "this shows" → "this is consistent with").
- The conclusion is an editorial opinion that goes beyond the case (sometimes okay — flag it so an editor can decide if it's appropriate to ship).

### 5. no overclaim — *are quantitative claims and counterfactuals appropriately hedged?*

**Pass test.** Two scans:

**Scan A — quantitative claims.** Find every number in the case body (deaths, dollars, percentages, "halved", "doubled", confidence intervals). Each number should be either (a) sourced to a reference, or (b) hedged ("approximately", "around", "an estimated").

**Scan B — counterfactuals.** Find every claim of the form "would have", "could have", "if X had been Y, then…". Each should be hedged ("might have", "would likely have", "the investigation concluded…").

If both scans come up clean, `✓`. If a number is missing a hedge but the source confirms it, `~`. If a number is unsupported, or a counterfactual is asserted as fact, `✗`.

**Common reasons to `✗`:**
- A specific death toll or dollar figure given without a citation.
- "The training would have prevented the accident" (strong counterfactual, no hedge, no source).
- Universal claims: "always", "never", "all", "every".

### 6. anchor fit — *does the primary `lens-anchor` match what the case engineers?*

**Pass test.** Read the `lens-approach:` block once more. Ask: does the assigned `lens-anchor` competency match what the case actually engineers or fails to engineer? Use the quick guide below.

**Quick guide to the five v2.1 competencies:**

| Anchor | Competency | The case is about… |
|---|---|---|
| **D1** | Systems Analysis | analysing what the work requires; capability requirements; cross-org integration; the system's structure as a problem. |
| **D2** | Iterative Development | a learning-engineering intervention designed + iterated; OR an organization that failed to iterate against opportunity (stagnation: Kodak, BlackBerry). |
| **D3** | Human-System Collaboration | interface design, alerts, mode/state transparency, authority gradient, who-can-stop-the-line; human-AI teaming is a sub-pattern here. |
| **D4** | Test and Evaluation | measurement, evidence architecture, gap attribution, fairness beyond omission, decision-grade evidence under uncertainty. |
| **D5** | Sociotechnical Constraints | deployment context; governance; regulatory regime; adoption; institution-building. |

If the `lens-anchor` is a clean fit for what the case engineers, mark `✓` — even if the `induced-anchor` points to a *different* domain. That cross-domain linkage is by design: the `lens-anchor` is what the case **does**, and the `induced-anchor` is the analytic dimension the case *also* evidences. A case can teach D3 (interface design) while contributing analytical evidence about D4 (measurement) — that's a feature.

Only mark `~` if the lens-anchor is defensible but another domain would clearly fit better; only mark `✗` if the lens-anchor is wrong. In a `~` or `✗`, name your alternative in *notes*.

**Heuristic for the dual-anchor case.** A typical valid pattern: a v2 cue/alert intervention case may carry `lens: D4/PT5` (because it evaluates the alert system's outcome) and `induced: 3.1` (because the case is analytically also about cue/alert design). Both are correct. Don't flag this as a mismatch — the dual-anchor design is doing its job.

### 7. x-refs — *does every "Case N" reference in this case resolve?*

**Pass test.** Find every `Case N` reference in the case's prose. For each:
1. Confirm Case N exists (use the matrix at the front of the book, or just count: any number 1–194 is in range, but you still need to confirm it's the case being claimed).
2. Open that case briefly. Is the pairing the current case claims real?

If every cross-reference resolves and the pairing makes sense, `✓`. If a referenced case exists but the pairing is loose, `~`. If a case number doesn't exist or the referenced case has nothing to do with the claim, `✗`.

## Workflow — how to review one case

1. **Pick the next unreviewed case** (the table is sorted by number; review in order). For the first session, start with **Case 1 (USS Fitzgerald & USS John S. McCain)** — it's a STRONG anchor and a clean v1 case, so it's a good calibration.
2. **Open the case file.** Cases are in `casebook/chapters/ch?X.typ`. The chapter is determined by the case number (see *Case-to-chapter map* below).
3. **Read the case end-to-end** before scoring anything. Don't score in chunks — you'll lose the sense of whether the conclusions follow from the body.
4. **Write a one-sentence summary** in your scratch notes (this is the clarity test).
5. **Open `verification-log.md`** and find the row for this case.
6. **Fill the 7 check columns** left to right. It's OK to come back to a check after a later one.
7. **For every `~` or `✗`**, write the specific note in the *notes* column. Be precise:
   - `✗`: *"Ref 3 (Smith 2019) — DOI doesn't resolve; couldn't find this paper on Google Scholar or the journal site."*
   - `~`: *"Hedge missing on 'halved surgical mortality' — source says 'reduced by approximately half (95% CI 35–60%)'; the case states it as a flat 'halved'."*
8. **Fill your initials + the date** in the reviewer / date columns.
9. **Commit the verification-log.md change** with a short message: *"Reviewed cases 1–5: clean except case 3 (refs real ✗)."*
10. **Move to the next case.**

### When to ask

- If you can't tell whether something should be `✗` or `~`, choose `~` and write the question.
- If a case feels outside your expertise (specialized medical, regulatory, or defense cases especially), mark *anchor fit* and *conclusions* as `?` and flag in notes for an editor with relevant domain knowledge.
- If a reference is paywalled and you can't read it, mark *refs support* as `~` with "paywalled, couldn't verify content."

### Pace

- ~30 minutes per case for the first 10 (learning the format).
- ~15 minutes per case after that.
- No more than 6–8 cases per sitting — quality drops sharply once you're tired.
- Commit at the end of every sitting so progress is recorded.

### Tools

- **Google Scholar** — scholar.google.com — the single most useful tool for *refs real* and *refs support*.
- **DOI.org** — resolves any DOI to its publisher page.
- **Agency websites** — NTSB.gov, FAA.gov, FDA.gov, OSHA.gov, GAO.gov, etc., for official reports.
- **arxiv.org** — for preprints.
- **The Wayback Machine** — web.archive.org — for dead URLs.
- **The book itself** — `casebook/build/capability-matters-digital.pdf` is the readable version; use it to read each case in formatted form rather than the Typst source.
