// Built dynamically by querying the <caseinfo> metadata that
// lib/case.typ emits for every case, so it stays in sync as cases
// are added (v1 1–100, v2 101–202, and beyond). Each case appears
// exactly once, under its PRIMARY domain (the first domain in its
// tag list), in case-number order. Core domains are ordered first;
// the remaining domains follow alphabetically. Where a hand-written
// callout exists for a domain, it opens that section (naming the
// dataset's standout failure and, where one exists, standout
// success); v2-introduced domains with no callout render as just a
// case list. Gold numbers indicate failures and systemic conditions;
// teal numbers indicate paired-intervention successes and the open
// closing case — same color code as the case matrix at the front.
