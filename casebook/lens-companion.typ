// ============================================================
// LENS COMPANION — Concentration docs + casebook crosswalks + appendices
//
// 8.5 × 11, white background. Digital reference companion to
// *Capability Matters: A Casebook*. Pairs the program's concentration
// documents (the v2.1 five competencies, the CLOs, the course mapping)
// with the casebook's crosswalks and indexes (cases by domain, by
// LENS course, references by case) so an instructor, recruiter, or
// outside reader can find every connection without holding both the
// casebook and the .docx originals.
//
// Build:
//   typst compile --font-path fonts --input view=companion \
//     lens-companion.typ build/capability-matters-lens-companion.pdf
//
// The view=companion flag tells lib/case.typ to emit per-case metadata
// only (no case body) — the appendices then query that metadata and
// render the indexes / per-case references the same way they do in
// the casebook.

  The LENS companion is a single, white-paper reference that pairs the
  program's concentration documentation with the casebook's crosswalks
  and indexes. It is built from the same source as *Capability Matters:
  A Casebook* but renders no case bodies — the casebook is the place to
  read the cases themselves; the companion is the place to find them.
