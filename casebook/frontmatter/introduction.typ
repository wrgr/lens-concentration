  The cases in this book are not, individually, hard to understand. A pilot
  recovered from a stall the wrong way. A nurse could not stop a doctor
  who skipped a step. A safety operator was watching television on her
  phone when a pedestrian crossed the road. A captain shot down a
  civilian airliner because the radar data and the operational framing
  pointed in opposite directions, and the framing won. The proximate
  cause is usually obvious. The first investigator on the scene almost
  always finds it within hours.

  What is hard to understand — and what this book exists to make legible —
  is the system that produced the gap into which each incident fell. In
  every case the proximate actor was operating inside an architecture of
  training, procedure, authority, measurement, and incentive that had,
  for years, been quietly degrading. The pilot had never trained to
  recover a stall at cruise altitude. The nurse had no procedural path
  to intervene. The safety operator had been hired into a role nobody
  had figured out how to make performable. The radar operator had been
  trained to a tempo and a presumption that the system above him no
  longer shared with the system around him.

  Each of these architectures was designed. Each was funded.
  Each was reviewed. Each carried, written somewhere in its specifications,
  the assumption that the people inside it would be able to do what the
  system required of them when the system required it. That assumption
  is what this book calls the *capability parameter*. It is a property
  of the entire sociotechnical system, not of any individual operator.
  Capability lives at the *interface* between what a system requires of
  its operators and the impact the system has to deliver — and when
  that interface is wrong, the gap may originate in human development,
  in system design, in organizational performance, or in the
  interaction among them. Distinguishing which is itself a measurement
  and engineering problem; the casebook calls it *gap attribution*,
  and treats it as the diagnostic move that the rest of the discipline
  depends on. When the interface fails — wherever the source — the
  consequences are paid in lives, in dollars, in trust, and in time
  the institution will never recover.

  The Institute of Medicine's *To Err Is Human* (1999) estimated that
  preventable medical error caused between forty-four thousand and
  ninety-eight thousand deaths a year in the United States — already, at
  the lower bound, a top-ten cause of death. The report catalyzed a
  generation of patient-safety work: surgical checklists, central-line
  bundles, team training, computerized order entry. Some of those
  interventions are documented in Part II of this book as successes.
  And yet in 2016 Makary and Daniel returned to the question from the
  same institution that produces this casebook and concluded that
  medical error remains the third leading cause of death in the United
  States, killing more than two hundred fifty thousand people a year

  program is operating at half of its design readiness in 2026 because
  the platform was fielded faster than the maintainer pipeline could be
  built #cite-num(5). One hundred million dollars of educational
  infrastructure dissolved in fourteen months because the institution
  building it did not engineer the governance and trust that the
  technology presupposed #cite-num(6). A predictive grading algorithm

  Crew Resource Management did not exist as a discipline in 1976. In
  March 1977 two 747s collided on a foggy runway at Tenerife and 583
  people died. Within five years United Airlines had operationalized
  the first CRM curriculum #cite-num(8); within twenty years the
  Commercial Aviation Safety Team had built the closed-loop
  hazard-identification system that lets the FAA know whether CRM is
  still working #cite-num(9). The result over the next two decades was
  an eighty-three percent reduction in U.S. commercial aviation
  fatality risk and a ninety-five percent reduction in fatalities per
  hundred million passengers #cite-num(10). CRM works not because it
  taught individual airmanship — pilots were already excellent — but
  because it redesigned the *system of interaction* in the cockpit:
  the authority gradient, the communication protocol, the standard
  brief and debrief. The discipline treated team coordination as an

  Operations within nine months — before the Kemeny Commission's report

  accident at any single plant would affect every operator's license to
  operate #cite-num(11). INPO and the National Academy for Nuclear
  Training, founded in 1985, have presided over more than four decades
  of zero significant releases at U.S. commercial reactors. The
  comparison with the surface Navy, which cut its training during the
  same era, is the cleanest available test of what happens when
  capability is engineered versus when it is deferred.

  Healthcare has its own version of this arc, but only partially. Peter
  Pronovost's central-line checklist, paired with the nurses'
  authority to enforce it, drove bloodstream infections to near zero
  across 103 Michigan ICUs and saved an estimated fifteen hundred lives
  in eighteen months #cite-num(12). Atul Gawande's nineteen-item
  surgical safety checklist, paired with three required pauses in the
  operative timeline, halved the surgical mortality rate across eight
  hospitals in eight countries #cite-num(13). TeamSTEPPS, jointly
  developed by AHRQ and DoD, translated five decades of high-reliability

  These are not stories about individual hospitals or individual ships.
  They are stories about the difference between a domain that has
  organized itself to engineer capability and one that has not. The
  pattern is consistent across all of them: a catastrophe makes the
  capability gap visible; an institution is built that treats the gap
  as the institution's responsibility; the institution funds the
  measurement architecture that lets it know whether the gap is closing;
  and twenty years later the death rate is half what it was. The
  intervention is always paired. A technical artifact — a checklist, a
  brief, a cord — combined with a cultural artifact — protected
  authority to use it, a no-blame protocol, a credible governance body.
  Neither alone moves the curve. Both together move it dramatically.

  LENS — Learning Engineering for Next-Generation Systems — is a
  specialization within the Johns Hopkins School of Education's
  Learning Design & Technology program that operationalizes this
  premise for high-consequence operational domains. Its core
  competencies — capability analysis and requirements, evidence and
  analytics, human-AI teaming, knowledge transfer, bias and governance,
  computational and AI methods — are organized to produce graduates who
  can do the work the cases in this book required, and who can build
  the institutions that the success cases in Part II had to invent.
  The curriculum threading commitments — implementation science as a
  through-line, equity as a design commitment rather than an audit,
  decision-grade evidence as a deliverable rather than a report,
  communication and system-of-systems integration as engineerable
  properties of the system, the disciplined use of learning-
  technology aids (from XR to adaptive platforms) as instruments
  whose evaluation is part of the work, and *AI as both a creative
  partner and an epistemic risk* — leveraging AI's generative reach
  while guarding against offloading the thinking — are drawn directly
  from the patterns the cases reveal.
]

#v(6pt)

#text(font: sans, size: 9.5pt, fill: text-dark)[
  Three of those commitments deserve a moment of their own — they are
  the substrate the rest of the curriculum runs on. The first is
  *communication, translation, and integration within and across
  disparate systems*. A striking number of cases in this book are,
  at their proximate cause, translation or integration failures
  across boundaries — failures of language, convention, unit, role,
  agency, or discipline to carry meaning reliably from one part of a
  system to another, or failures of subsystems built to different
  assumptions to compose into a working whole. Mars Climate Orbiter was a metric-versus-
  imperial translation failure (Case 22). Tenerife was a translation
  failure at the takeoff-clearance boundary between two cockpits and
  a tower under fog and time pressure (Case 103). The Patriot at
  Dhahran failed because the manufacturer's assumption about run
  time and the operator's actual run time were on opposite sides of
  a documentation boundary that had not been engineered to be
  crossed (Case 19). Eagle Claw failed because the rotary-wing,
  fixed-wing, ground, and command components were assembled across
  service boundaries that had no shared operating practice (Case 12).
  9/11 was a cross-agency translation failure measured in thousands
  of dead (Case 97). Boeing 737 MAX was, at one level, an integration
  failure: a single-string sensor, a flight-control law that assumed
  pilot mental models from prior models, and a certification chain
  that did not knit the pieces together (Case 17). The successful
  cases — AlphaFold (Case 183), MICrONS, CRM (Case 103 paired with
  Case 108), Keystone (Case 105), the paired-intervention examples in
  Chapter 8 — are, equivalently, cases of disciplined translation
  and integration: biology into computation, science into
  operational practice, technical reform into cultural reform,
  multiple subsystems into a working whole. Engineering capability
  across these boundaries — language, discipline, agency,
  subsystem-to-subsystem, system-of-systems — is itself a designable
  target. The LENS curriculum treats it as such.
]

#v(6pt)

#text(font: sans, size: 9.5pt, fill: text-dark)[
  The second is *technology aids and learning platforms*. The
  discipline has at its disposal a fast-evolving toolkit: extended-
  reality (XR) simulation environments — VR, AR, and mixed-reality
  systems used for procedural training, spatial-reasoning practice,
  and high-fidelity rehearsal under conditions that would be
  unsafe or impossible in the field — together with learning-
  management systems, adaptive learning platforms (the lineage from
  Cognitive Tutor and ASSISTments to current ITS work; Cases 113,
  85), intelligent tutoring frameworks such as GIFT, learning-
  analytics infrastructures such as xAPI and the Total Learning
  Architecture (Case 86), game-based learning environments, LLM-
  augmented tutors and authoring tools, and high-fidelity simulators
  in aviation, surgery, defense, and process industries. These tools
  are not the discipline. They are the discipline's instruments —
  and the cases in this book show, repeatedly, that powerful
  instruments do not by themselves engineer capability (Cases 45,
  49, 35, 85, 181, 184). The LENS curriculum teaches the practitioner
  to choose, configure, evaluate, and govern these tools with the
  same evidentiary discipline applied to any other intervention,
  and to recognize when the binding constraint is the surrounding
  architecture rather than the tool itself.
]

#v(6pt)

#text(font: sans, size: 9.5pt, fill: text-dark)[
  The third — and the design constraint on all the others — is
  *human agency*. The capability discipline can be misread as
  optimization: produce operators whose behavior matches a
  specification. That reading collapses the very property the cases
  reveal as load-bearing. Every successful institution in Part II —
  INPO operators trained to challenge their reactor team, Keystone
  ICU nurses authorized to halt a procedure (Case 105), the Nuclear
  Navy's questioning attitude (Case 111), the first-officer authority
  CRM built into the cockpit (Case 103) — engineered for capability
  *and* for the operator's capacity to exercise independent
  judgment, to adapt to conditions the system was not designed for,
  and to shape the surrounding architecture rather than only
  execute inside it. Capability without that capacity is
  automation. LENS treats the preservation and development of
  agency — the room the system leaves its operators to think,
  decide, and lead — as a design constraint on every intervention,
  including those in which AI is the partner. The paired risk runs
  the same direction: an AI collaborator can accelerate the flywheel
  or quietly offload the thinking, and which one it does is a
  design and governance decision, not a property of the tool.

  Learning engineering is not a one-time act of design. Its defining
  feature, as articulated in the IEEE Industry Connections Industry
  Consortium on Learning Engineering's process model, is iteration:
  understand the operational context, specify capability requirements,
  prototype an intervention, instrument it, measure, learn, redesign.
  The work cycles. The cases in this book that produced sustained
  outcomes — CRM and CAST, INPO, Keystone ICU, the WHO Surgical
  Safety Checklist, TeamSTEPPS — all share that loop structure. They
  were not built once and left alone. They were built, measured,
  rebuilt, remeasured, and rebuilt again. The institutional capability
  to sustain the loop *is* what distinguishes them from interventions
  whose effects decayed.
]

#v(6pt)

#text(font: sans, size: 9.5pt, fill: text-dark)[
  The loop also has a legitimate negative result, and the discipline
  has to be honest enough to reach it. Capability engineering always
  operates inside constraints — budget, schedule, regulation,
  institutional will, politics, ethics, public trust — and many of
  the binding ones are not technical. Part of the work is *managing
  those constraints and the risk they carry*: reading the constraint
  space accurately enough to recognize when external, non-technical
  factors have narrowed the solution space to the point where a
  particular capability goal is no longer realistic to pursue.
  Reaching that conclusion — and documenting *why* — is itself a
  valid outcome of a project, not a failure of one. It redirects
  effort toward goals that are actually reachable, surfaces the
  non-technical barriers for the stakeholders who can change them,
  and prevents the far more expensive failure of driving an
  infeasible target all the way to the operational record before it
  collapses there. A number of cases in this book are, in part,
  stories of institutions that could not say "not like this, not
  yet" in time.

  The casebook turns this loop into a reading method. Each case is
  read, diagnosed, paired with a learning-engineering response, and
  tested in studio against students' own operational domains. The
  cycle — framing the system whose capability is at stake, eliciting
  requirements from operational analysis, building the evidence
  architecture that lets an institution know whether its interventions
  worked, examining the human and AI roles inside the designed system,
  and running the loop end-to-end on a real problem — is the same
  discipline the casebook applies to every case it reads. The cases
  that return as success stories in Part II are the cases whose
  institutions completed the loop. The cases in Part I are the cases
  whose institutions did not — or did not loop fast enough.
  Unpacking the case *is* the method: identify, instrument, and close
  the next such loop before the next case is written.

  Three phrases recur across those five capabilities and across the
  cases that follow: *within and across disparate systems* (the scope
  at which capability is actually engineered), *speed and scale* (the
  operational tempo the discipline must match), and *gap attribution
  between learning, system design, and organizational performance
  problems* (the diagnostic that decides what kind of intervention will
  actually move the outcome). They are the working language the cases
  are read in.

  Part I, "The Failure Modes," organizes the failure cases under six
  recurring patterns: training gap, capability designed out,
  normalization of deviance, interface failure, governance failure, and
  knowledge loss. A seventh chapter — the Evidence Gap — anchors the
  measurement question. The taxonomy is not a theory. It is a finding:
  six categories that account for almost every well-documented case in
  the literature of preventable failure in complex sociotechnical
  systems, and that recur across healthcare, defense, education,
  energy, transportation, and government.

  Part II, "What Works," collects the cases in which the capability
  parameter was engineered rather than left to drift. Every success
  case in the dataset shares a structural feature: a *paired
  intervention.* A technical artifact paired with a cultural authority.
  A measurement instrument paired with a governance body that listens
  to it. A curriculum paired with the institutional architecture to
  sustain it. Neither half alone moves the curve. The pair is
  irreducible. This is the strongest empirical pattern in the book and
  it directly informs the LENS pedagogical commitment to co-optimization
  across technical and human design.

  Part III, "The Frontier," concerns the cases where the discipline is
  being asked to do work it has not done before — particularly the
  human-AI teaming cases that anticipate the next decade of capability
  engineering. The cases are deliberately less settled. The discipline
  is being asked to specify what good looks like before the catastrophe
  arrives. That is the work the program exists to teach.

  Each case occupies a two-page spread. The left page tells what
  happened — narrative, evidence, attribution. The right page is the
  *Learning Engineering Lens:* a synthesis of what the case teaches,
  how the LENS curriculum addresses the pattern, and reflection
  questions designed for studio discussion. The casebook is built to be
  taught from, read straight through, or consulted as a reference. The
  curriculum crosswalk in the closing matter maps each case to the
  specific courses in the program that use it as a worked example.

    *How these cases were chosen.* The collection is purposive, not
    systematic. The cases are exemplars — drawn from the documented
    public record and from the editors' own practice — selected because
    each makes a capability-engineering pattern legible, not because
    they constitute a representative or exhaustive sample. The corpus
    over-represents catastrophic, well-investigated failures, which
    generate the richest public record, and under-represents the
    everyday, program-scale work that fills most of a practitioner's
    career; a deliberate expansion has begun to close that gap. Read the
    book as a teaching instrument rather than a systematic review: the
    claim is that these patterns recur and are engineerable — not that
    this is every case, or the average one.
