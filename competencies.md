# Learning-engineering competencies (grounded in the casebook)

*Induced from 100 documented cases in the Capability Matters casebook. Each competency is supported by multiple cases; each sub-competency cites the cases that establish it. Failures (n=72) show what's missing; interventions (n=16) show what works; frontier cases (n=12) show what the discipline is being asked to specify next.*

## What this framework is induced from — and isn't

The v1 casebook is shaped by what gets documented in public. It over-samples catastrophic, news-visible failures from defense, aviation, healthcare, finance, and high-stakes ed-tech, and under-samples the everyday, study- and program-scale work that fills most of a learning engineer's actual practice. That sampling bias propagates into the framework below.

Specifically, three competencies are read most narrowly because of it:

- **Competency 2 (Evidence architecture)** is induced almost entirely from institution-deceives-itself cases at the Wells Fargo / VA / BP scale. The everyday version of the same competency — *did this micro-intervention actually move the learner, and how do you know* — is barely represented.
- **Competency 5 (Governance architecture)** is induced from catastrophic-scale governance failures. The routine forms — IRB-grade study protocols, change-control for instructional content, disclosure of instructor effects, vendor-data agreements — are barely represented.
- **Competency 8 (Equity and construct definition)** plays out most often at study- and program-scale (a cohort effect in a single-district pilot, a construct-validity drift across raters). Those rarely make the news, so the competency is named mostly from its loudest instances.

Read the framework accordingly: it is a high-stakes-failure induction, not a complete map of the discipline. A second-pass sweep at journal- and conference-scale evidence (see `case-sweep-v2-plan.md`) is queued to close the gap.

## Method

I read the LENS-approach and summary fields for all 100 cases, set aside the LEN 1–10 course tags and the T/D/N/H/G/K modes as seed categories, and instead listed the recurring capability demand that each case names. I then clustered those demands inductively: a candidate top-level competency was retained only if at least ten distinct cases demanded it, and a sub-competency only if at least three distinct cases established it. Where a candidate cluster slimmed below threshold, I either dropped it or merged it into an adjacent cluster (e.g., "construct definition" merged into the equity sub-cluster; "cross-domain transfer" merged into knowledge & adoption). The eight competencies below survived this pruning. The optional crosswalk at the end observes how the induced clusters relate to the modes T/D/N/H/G/K and to LEN 1–10 — purely as observation, not as anchor.

## 1. Capability requirements specification under operational reality

The recurring demand is to derive what the work actually requires from operational analysis — and to make that specification falsifiable against outcomes — rather than inheriting the requirements implied by the contract, the schedule, or the prior platform. Cases that fail here mistake stated readiness for real readiness (Case 1, USS Fitzgerald) or engineer human capability out of the loop to avoid the cost of sustaining it (Case 2, 737 MAX). The intervention cases (Cases 15, 28) show what the deliverable looks like when it is actually produced.

### 1.1 Engineered vs. stated requirements

Distinguish the readiness an organization declares from the readiness the engineered system can actually produce — and treat the gap itself as the analyst's primary artifact. Cases here either failed because nobody owned that gap or succeeded by making the gap visible and fundable.
Cases: 1 (USS Fitzgerald & McCain), 9 (INDOPACOM Marine training), 15 (Navy Surface Warfare Reform), 26 (F-35 Sustainment), 28 (U.S. Nuclear Navy / Rickover), 38 (GIFT adoption gap).

### 1.2 Capability envelope at the edge of training

Specify the operational envelope separately from the trained envelope, and design for the boundary between them — particularly transitions out of automated or normal-regime operation. The recurring failure is that training covered the routine and not the edge.
Cases: 3 (Air France 447), 30 (Kegworth), 47 (Helios 522), 48 (AeroPerú 603), 50 (TransAsia 235), 63 (Eastern 401).

### 1.3 Cross-organization and joint-service requirements

When a capability spans services, agencies, or contractors, no single party owns the integrated requirement, and the interface between them becomes the load-bearing artifact. The recurring failure is that each party did its piece correctly while the whole did not work.
Cases: 33 (Military Fratricide), 46 (Operation Eagle Claw), 54 (Mars Climate Orbiter), 79 (Boeing Starliner), 86 (9/11 Intelligence Sharing).

### 1.4 Requirements as a sustainment deliverable

Capability requirements are not satisfied at fielding; they must be continuously specified for the maintainer pipeline, the technical-data pathway, the depot, and the operator population. The recurring failure is fielding a platform faster than the infrastructure to sustain it.
Cases: 11 (V-22 Osprey), 18 (USS Vincennes), 26 (F-35 Sustainment), 79 (Boeing Starliner).

## 2. Evidence architecture the institution cannot deceive itself with

Across the dataset the most consistent failure is not the absence of measurement but the presence of the wrong measurement, gamed measurement, or measurement that the institution operating the instrument also controls. The competency is to design instruments that surface the harm they exist to detect (Cases 31, 56) and that resist the incentive to make them lie (Cases 60, 71). Interventions (Cases 12 CAST, 14 Keystone, 89 ASRS, 90 Bristol) show what the deliverable looks like when it is built right.

### 2.1 Measuring the failure mode you care about

The construct measured must be the construct that produces harm, not the construct that is easy to count. Personal-safety vs. process-safety (Texas City), death certificates vs. medical error (Case 31), and aggregate revenue vs. account legitimacy (Wells Fargo) are the canonical inversions.
Cases: 31 (Medical Errors), 56 (Texas City BP), 58 (Mid Staffordshire), 70 (Wells Fargo), 83 (LIBOR), 90 (Bristol Heart Babies).

### 2.2 Protecting the measurement from gaming

When the institution being measured controls the instrument, the instrument will be gamed. The competency is to specify independence, audit, and the boundary between operator and inspector, and to treat measurement-gaming as a foreseeable design load rather than a moral aberration.
Cases: 32 (VA Wait Times), 60 (Upper Big Branch), 70 (Wells Fargo), 71 (Volkswagen Dieselgate), 83 (LIBOR), 84 (Atlanta Public Schools Cheating).

### 2.3 Closed-loop evidence linked to intervention

The instrument is paired with an intervention path; signal without a path to redesign is not learning. The interventions that worked all paired a measurement with a specific authorized action — the checklist that stops surgery, the CAST analysis that funds a fix, the ASRS report that adjusts a procedure.
Cases: 12 (CRM & CAST), 13 (WHO Surgical Checklist), 14 (Keystone ICU), 15 (Navy SWO Reform), 39 (Georgia State University), 42 (Cognitive Tutor), 89 (ASRS).

### 2.4 Post-deployment surveillance and disconfirmation

Capability evidence has to keep coming in after launch, including the capacity to absorb a disconfirming result. The recurring failure is to treat clearance, certification, or pilot results as the end of the evidence pipeline rather than the start.
Cases: 22 (Tennessee Pre-K), 49 (Atlas Air 3591), 52 (Takata), 87 (Vioxx), 95 (Radiology AI Miscalibration).

## 3. Interface and role design at the human–automation boundary

A recurring pattern is that the most advanced system available failed at the seam between the automation and the operator: cues carried two meanings (Helios), the failure was silent (Northeast Blackout), or the human was kept in a monitoring role that humans cannot actually perform (Uber ATG, Tesla Autopilot). The discipline must treat the interface as a capability deliverable and the role as something engineered, not assumed. Petrov (Case 66) is the positive existence proof: keeping a human in some loops is itself capability engineering.

### 3.1 Cue and alert design as a capability deliverable

A cue that means two things, an alert that fires when no one is listening, or an interface that does not signal which state the system is in shifts the diagnostic burden onto the operator at the worst moment. The competency is to specify cue uniqueness, alert prioritization, and mode salience as deliverables of the design.
Cases: 7 (Therac-25), 25 (EHR/CPOE), 47 (Helios 522), 48 (AeroPerú 603), 63 (Eastern 401).

### 3.2 Monitoring as an unsupportable role

Passive monitoring of capable automation degrades attention in ways the literature has long documented; deploying systems that depend on it without engineering the role is foreseeably hazardous. The competency is to either redesign the role so it is performable or to make the case for not retaining it.
Cases: 29 (Uber ATG / Tempe), 36 (Robodebt), 62 (Northeast Blackout), 68 (UK Post Office Horizon), 92 (Tesla Autopilot).

### 3.3 Mode and state transparency under stress

When the human is most loaded — combat, system reconfiguration, an evolving fault — the interface must make the system's mode and state legible without further cognitive cost. The recurring failure is that the operator's mental model and the system's actual state diverged silently.
Cases: 1 (USS McCain helm), 18 (USS Vincennes), 19 (Patriot/Dhahran), 44 (Asiana 214), 65 (CrowdStrike).

### 3.4 Recoverability from automation failure

The human is the recoverability of automation failures the designers did not anticipate; specifying that role — its training, its authority, its information — is itself the deliverable. Failures here designed the human out (Cases 2, 36); the positive case (Case 66) shows what it looks like when the role is kept and supported.
Cases: 2 (737 MAX), 3 (Air France 447), 36 (Robodebt), 62 (Northeast Blackout), 66 (Stanislav Petrov), 96 (ChatGPT in Healthcare).

## 4. Pairing mechanism with authorization (the cultural half)

The dataset's strongest interventions all pair a mechanical artifact with the institutional authorization to use it: a checklist with a nurse who can stop the procedure (Case 14), a cord with a worker who can stop the line (Case 24), a reporting form with immunity from enforcement (Case 89), a recall decision with a pre-committed credo (Case 88). Cases that imported the artifact without the authorization (American adoption of the Andon cord; checklists in Ontario) under-delivered. The competency is to make the authorization itself a falsifiable design artifact rather than an aspiration.

### 4.1 Frontline authority to halt or escalate

The lowest-ranking person who can see the problem must have the authority to act on it, and that authority must be visibly backed by the supervisor and the institution. The recurring intervention is to engineer that authority explicitly and treat its absence as a defect.
Cases: 14 (Keystone ICU), 24 (Toyota Andon Cord), 45 (Mark 14 Torpedo), 66 (Stanislav Petrov).

### 4.2 Non-punitive reporting with credible commitment

Honest reporting of incidents and near-misses requires that the institution credibly commit not to punish the report itself. The ASRS architecture — confidentiality plus immunity within specified limits — is the canonical worked example; failures (Mark 14, VA, UBB) show what happens when the channel is missing or compromised.
Cases: 32 (VA Wait Times), 45 (Mark 14 Torpedo), 60 (Upper Big Branch), 89 (ASRS).

### 4.3 Authority gradient and team-coordination redesign

Where the cockpit, the OR, or the control room concentrates authority in one role, errors visible to others may never reach the decision. The intervention is to redesign the team's communication and authority structure deliberately, including adaptation across cultural contexts.
Cases: 12 (CRM & CAST), 23 (Korean Air), 27 (TeamSTEPPS), 91 (Singapore Airlines).

### 4.4 Pre-committed institutional response

The strongest crisis interventions were pre-committed before the crisis arrived: J&J's credo was written in 1943 and executed in 1982; INPO's structure was designed for catastrophe before the next one occurred. The competency is to specify, fund, and rehearse the institutional response as a deliverable.
Cases: 16 (INPO), 88 (Tylenol Recall), 93 (Cruise Robotaxi).

## 5. Governance architecture for deployment: consent, oversight, accountability

A working technology can fail entirely on its governance: inBloom's data infrastructure was technically sound and died of consent failure; Summit Learning had a defensible pedagogy and died of deployment governance; Cruise's robotaxi technology produced one injury and its partial-disclosure response ended the program. The competency is to engineer the governance artifacts — stakeholder trust, oversight, the response posture — alongside the tool and before deployment, not as a remediation when something goes wrong.

### 5.1 Stakeholder trust and consent as preconditions

In domains with non-consenting populations — students, patients, citizens — the consent framework and the public-facing evidence summary are load-bearing structure, not optional features. The recurring failure is technocratic deployment that assumed technical soundness would generate its own legitimacy.
Cases: 8 (inBloom), 21 (Summit Learning), 22 (Tennessee Pre-K), 72 (Cambridge Analytica).

### 5.2 Human-in-the-loop for consequential decisions

Automated decision systems that allocate benefits, liberty, or care require deliverable-grade accountability artifacts — appeal paths, human review, the lawful basis — before deployment. Failures here designed the human out of the loop entirely; the positive case (GSU) used the prediction to trigger more human support, not to gatekeep.
Cases: 36 (Robodebt), 39 (Georgia State University), 68 (UK Post Office Horizon), 94 (COMPAS), 97 (Predictive Policing).

### 5.3 Cross-regime and platform governance seams

Where regulatory regimes meet (FDA vs. CLIA, securities vs. consumer protection), platforms span jurisdictions, or APIs assume benevolent use, the seam itself is a governance artifact that someone must own. The recurring failure is fraud or harm exploiting the gap between regimes.
Cases: 25 (EHR/CPOE), 69 (Theranos), 72 (Cambridge Analytica), 85 (Madoff/SEC), 95 (Radiology AI Miscalibration).

### 5.4 Change-control and disclosure as governance artifacts

A change to a load-bearing element — a connection detail, a part number, a content update — must trigger a documented review by someone with the authority and information to catch the consequence. Disclosure of harm, when it occurs, is itself part of the deployment artifact.
Cases: 53 (GM Ignition Switch), 65 (CrowdStrike), 67 (TSB Bank Migration), 74 (Hyatt Regency Walkway), 75 (FIU Pedestrian Bridge), 93 (Cruise Robotaxi).

## 6. Cross-organization and cross-time knowledge transfer

Many cases turn on the question of whether what one part of the system already knew ever reached the part that needed it: the Davis-Besse near-miss the U.S. nuclear fleet did not absorb before TMI; the FBI Phoenix memo the rest of government never integrated before 9/11; the Israeli Patriot drift report that reached Dhahran a day late; the Saturn V manufacturing knowledge that walked out with the workforce. The discipline must engineer the transfer architecture explicitly — across organizations, across generations, and across domains.

### 6.1 Industry-level institution building after catastrophe

A single operator cannot engineer the safety of a whole industry alone; the discipline must build the cross-organization institutions that distribute the cost of capability — peer review, mutual accreditation, joint commands. INPO, USDS, USSOCOM, CSB, and ODNI all originate as institutional answers to catastrophes the prior architecture could not absorb.
Cases: 5 (Three Mile Island), 10 (Healthcare.gov / USDS), 16 (INPO), 17 (Bhopal / CSB), 27 (TeamSTEPPS), 43 (Colgan Air 3407), 46 (Operation Eagle Claw), 86 (9/11 Intelligence Sharing).

### 6.2 Operator-to-institution feedback channels

The operators with the diagnostic information often have no structural channel to escalate it; the institution insulated from them rejects the diagnosis. The competency is to engineer the channel — the structure, the standing, the obligation to act — so the diagnosis reaches the decision.
Cases: 32 (VA Wait Times), 45 (Mark 14 Torpedo), 57 (Davis-Besse), 89 (ASRS).

### 6.3 Sustaining tacit capability across generations

Documentation is not the capability; the practical knowledge of how to build, operate, and maintain a system lives in the workforce, and is lost when the workforce retires without overlap. The competency is to engineer apprenticeship, retention, and the deliberate transfer of tacit knowledge as part of the program plan.
Cases: 28 (U.S. Nuclear Navy / Rickover), 32 (VA Wait Times), 78 (NASA Saturn V Documentation), 79 (Boeing Starliner).

### 6.4 Cross-domain adaptation of proven interventions

Healthcare absorbed CRM as TeamSTEPPS; healthcare ICUs absorbed checklists as Keystone; nuclear took aviation-style debriefing. Each successful translation required adapting the intervention's mechanism and its authorization to the receiving domain — and resisting the temptation to import only the artifact.
Cases: 12 (CRM & CAST), 23 (Korean Air), 24 (Toyota Andon Cord), 27 (TeamSTEPPS), 41 (Implementation Science 17-Year Gap), 81 (Tacoma Narrows).

## 7. Capability under system change, transition, and aging assumptions

A repeated pattern is that the original design carried an assumption — about uptime, about the operating envelope, about the climate, about who would use the system — that no one carried forward when the conditions changed. Patriot was built for short Cold-War engagements (Case 19); Ariane 5 reused Ariane 4's narrower trajectory code (Case 80); Kegworth's crew flew the engine layout of last week's airframe (Case 30); PG&E's lines were built for a wetter California (Case 76). The competency is to make assumption migration an engineered event with a deliverable.

### 7.1 Re-verifying inherited designs in new envelopes

When software, hardware, or procedures cross into a system with a different operating envelope, the prior verification does not carry over; re-verification is the deliverable. The recurring failure is treating reuse as risk-free.
Cases: 2 (737 MAX), 19 (Patriot/Dhahran), 30 (Kegworth), 80 (Ariane 5).

### 7.2 Deployment and reuse as verification events

A code push, a content update, or a migration weekend is not an administrative event but a verification event; the pipeline that does not treat it as such will fail catastrophically when something edge-case fires. Knight Capital, CrowdStrike, and TSB are the canonical worked examples.
Cases: 55 (Knight Capital), 65 (CrowdStrike), 67 (TSB Bank Migration).

### 7.3 Legacy assets aging past their oversight regime

Infrastructure built for one set of operating conditions — a wetter climate, a different fault model, a peacetime gas-storage cadence — eventually outlives the inspection regime that was sized to it. The competency is to specify the assumption-migration review as a recurring obligation, not a one-time engineering act.
Cases: 76 (Camp Fire / PG&E), 77 (Texas Grid Freeze), 82 (Aliso Canyon).

### 7.4 Multi-layer drift and cumulative inadequacy

A cascade of marginal-but-tolerable conditions across multiple defense layers eventually aligns into catastrophe — each layer reported as acceptable in isolation, none monitored as a system. The competency is to instrument and analyze the multi-layer state rather than the per-layer signal.
Cases: 4 (Deepwater Horizon), 6 (Challenger & Columbia), 11 (V-22 Osprey), 17 (Bhopal), 20 (Grenfell Tower), 59 (Sago Mine), 61 (Fukushima Daiichi), 73 (Equifax).

## 8. Equity and construct definition as design commitments

The dataset's algorithmic-deployment cases turn on a single recurring observation: the choice of what to predict, who counts as "at-risk," what counts as recidivism, or what "crime" the historical data records is itself the load-bearing design decision — not a downstream operational concern. inBloom failed not on bias but on consent (Case 8); Ofqual failed because the construct it standardized encoded existing inequality (Case 35); PredPol failed because it predicted enforcement, not crime (Case 97); Georgia State succeeded because it built equity in from the start as a primary outcome (Case 39). The competency is to treat equity and construct definition as design commitments measurable at deployment, not modules added at audit.

### 8.1 Choosing the construct (what gets predicted, what counts)

The unit of measurement is a capability decision with equity consequences: where police have enforced is not where crime has occurred; appointment-list compliance is not access; recidivism is a definition before it is a prediction. The competency is to interrogate the construct before the model.
Cases: 32 (VA Wait Times), 35 (UK A-Level Algorithm), 37 (Educational Predictive Analytics), 94 (COMPAS), 97 (Predictive Policing).

### 8.2 Demographic stratification of validation and outcomes

Aggregate validation accuracy can hide concentrated harm to under-represented groups; the competency is to require stratified validation and post-deployment outcome monitoring as routine deliverables. The failure pattern is FDA clearance, regulator approval, or vendor self-report based on aggregate metrics that did not stratify.
Cases: 35 (UK A-Level Algorithm), 37 (Educational Predictive Analytics), 94 (COMPAS), 95 (Radiology AI Miscalibration).

### 8.3 Designing predictions to trigger support, not gatekeeping

When a predictive system is built to allocate help rather than to allocate scarcity, equity gaps are easier to close; when the same prediction is used to gatekeep, the bias is amplified into the allocation. Georgia State is the positive existence proof.
Cases: 36 (Robodebt), 37 (Educational Predictive Analytics), 39 (Georgia State University), 68 (UK Post Office Horizon).

### 8.4 Surfacing bias through governance, not just technique

Bias-detection technique is necessary but insufficient; the question of which fairness criterion is satisfied (and which is sacrificed) is a governance decision that must be made by an accountable party, not by a model vendor's default. COMPAS is the case where the technical impossibility result was already known, and the governance question was who decided.
Cases: 8 (inBloom), 84 (Atlanta Public Schools), 94 (COMPAS), 97 (Predictive Policing), 98 (AlphaFold).

## Crosswalk note (optional)

The induced clusters relate to the modes T/D/N/H/G/K but do not align cleanly with any single mode. Competency 1 (requirements specification) is mostly T (training-gap) cases but draws on D (designed-out) where the requirement was deliberately removed (Case 2 MAX). Competency 2 (evidence architecture) cuts across N (normalization) and G (governance) and is the central translation of K (knowledge) into instruments. Competency 3 (interface and roles) maps most directly onto H, but always paired with D (the safeguard removed) or T (the role not trained). Competency 4 (mechanism + authorization) is the N+G pair that the dataset most rewards. Competency 5 (governance architecture) is mostly G with H sub-cluster 5.2. Competency 6 (knowledge transfer) is K, with G as the architecture that carries K. Competency 7 (change and aging) is the under-named cluster behind many D and N failures. Competency 8 (equity and construct) cuts across G and K and is the cluster that the frontier cases most demand the discipline name.

Against the LEN 1–10 curriculum, the induced competencies cover the same ground but with different cuts. LEN 5 (Capability Analysis) maps closely to induced Competency 1 plus the systems-of-systems portions of 6 and 7. LEN 4 (Evidence) maps closely to Competency 2 and to sub-cluster 8.2. LEN 2 (Human–AI Teaming) maps closely to Competency 3 and to sub-cluster 5.2. LEN 7 (Governance) maps to Competency 5 plus the cross-cutting governance sub-clusters in 6 and 8. LEN 8 (Organizational Learning) maps to Competency 6 plus Competency 7. Competency 4 (mechanism + authorization) and Competency 8 (equity as design commitment) are the two clusters this induction names most distinctly that do not map to a single LEN course; both surface as a recurring demand across multiple courses' cases, which suggests they may be cross-cutting threads of the discipline rather than course-level topics.
