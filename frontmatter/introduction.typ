  The cases in this book are not, individually, hard to understand. A pilot
  recovered from a stall the wrong way. A nurse could not stop a doctor
  who skipped a step. A safety operator was watching television on her
  phone when a pedestrian crossed the road. A captain shot down a
  civilian airliner because the radar data and the operational framing
  pointed in opposite directions, and the framing won. The proximate
  cause is usually obvious. The first investigator on the scene almost
  always finds it within hours.

  What is hard to understand — and what this book exists to make legible —
  is the system that produced the gap into which each incident fell. In
  every case the proximate actor was operating inside an architecture of
  training, procedure, authority, measurement, and incentive that had,
  for years, been quietly degrading. The pilot had never trained to
  recover a stall at cruise altitude. The nurse had no procedural path
  to intervene. The safety operator had been hired into a role nobody
  had figured out how to make performable. The radar operator had been
  trained to a tempo and a presumption that the system above him no
  longer shared with the system around him.

  Each of these architectures was designed. Each was funded.
  Each was reviewed. Each carried, written somewhere in its specifications,
  the assumption that the people inside it would be able to do what the
  system required of them when the system required it. That assumption
  is what this book calls the *capability parameter*. It is a property
  of the entire sociotechnical system, not of any individual operator.
  When it is wrong, the consequences are paid in lives, in dollars, in
  trust, and in time the institution will never recover.

  The Institute of Medicine's *To Err Is Human* (1999) estimated that
  preventable medical error caused between forty-four thousand and
  ninety-eight thousand deaths a year in the United States — already, at
  the lower bound, a top-ten cause of death. The report catalyzed a
  generation of patient-safety work: surgical checklists, central-line
  bundles, team training, computerized order entry. Some of those
  interventions are documented in Part II of this book as successes.

  same institution that produces this casebook and concluded that
  medical error remains the third leading cause of death in the United

  program is operating at half of its design readiness in 2026 because
  the platform was fielded faster than the maintainer pipeline could be
  built #cite-num(5). One hundred million dollars of educational
  infrastructure dissolved in fourteen months because the institution

  Crew Resource Management did not exist as a discipline in 1976. In
  March 1977 two 747s collided on a foggy runway at Tenerife and 583
  people died. Within five years United Airlines had operationalized
  the first CRM curriculum #cite-num(8); within twenty years the
  Commercial Aviation Safety Team had built the closed-loop
  hazard-identification system that lets the FAA know whether CRM is
  still working #cite-num(9). The result over the next two decades was
  an eighty-three percent reduction in U.S. commercial aviation
  fatality risk and a ninety-five percent reduction in fatalities per
  hundred million passengers #cite-num(10). CRM works not because it
  taught individual airmanship — pilots were already excellent — but

  Pronovost's central-line checklist, paired with the nurses'

  These are not stories about individual hospitals or individual ships.

  organized itself to engineer capability and one that has not. The
  pattern is consistent across all of them: a catastrophe makes the
  capability gap visible; an institution is built that treats the gap
  as the institution's responsibility; the institution funds the
  measurement architecture that lets it know whether the gap is closing;
  and twenty years later the death rate is half what it was. The
  intervention is always paired. A technical artifact — a checklist, a
  brief, a cord — combined with a cultural artifact — protected
  authority to use it, a no-blame protocol, a credible governance body.
  Neither alone moves the curve. Both together move it dramatically.

  Learning engineering is not a one-time act of design. Its defining
  feature, as articulated in the IEEE Industry Connections Industry
  Consortium on Learning Engineering's process model, is iteration:
  understand the operational context, specify capability requirements,

  The work cycles. The cases in this book that produced sustained
  outcomes — CRM and CAST, INPO, Keystone ICU, the WHO Surgical
  Safety Checklist, TeamSTEPPS — all share that loop structure. They
  were not built once and left alone. They were built, measured,
  rebuilt, remeasured, and rebuilt again. The institutional capability

  capability is at stake. LEN 5 elicits requirements from operational
  analysis. LEN 4 builds the evidence architecture that lets the
  institution know whether its interventions worked. LEN 2 examines
  the human and AI roles inside the designed system. LEN 10 — Studio —
  asks students to do all of it on a single integrated project,
  carrying the loop through one full iteration on a real operational
  problem. Electives extend the loop: LEN 7 (Bias, Risk, and

  The first is the *CIRCUIT model, MERIT framework, and COMPASS
  content* — a more-than-decade record originating at the JHU
  Applied Physics Laboratory. CIRCUIT (Cohort-based Integrated
  Research Community for Undergraduate Innovation and Trailblazing)
  was built as the best operational solution to the IARPA MICrONS
  connectomics program's proofreading requirement, and was
  subsequently extended to additional sponsor problems. The
  *scientific and engineering impact* the trained cohorts produced
  — peer-reviewed contributions to the MICrONS reconstructions in
  *Nature*, the open-data infrastructure of BossDB and CAVE, the
  NeuVue proofreading framework — is the headline result; the
  student development was a deliberate and well-engineered
  byproduct of the mission solution, making doing well for the
  sponsor compound with doing good for the students. MERIT
  (Mentoring Exceptional Researchers to Innovate and Thrive) is the
  generalization of the CIRCUIT model into a replicable framework:
  holistic recruiting, the CIRCUIT eight pillars, the CCR
  competency framework, and the explicit "hidden curriculum"
  literature. *COMPASS-Core* is the ten-workshop mentoring
  curriculum that operationalizes MERIT inside a specific
  institutional setting — orientation and goal-setting, resilience
  and mindset, research-navigation, networking and faculty
  engagement, scientific reading and writing, presentations and
  figures, metacognition and advanced study, professional conduct
  and ethics, STEM identity and purpose, and long-term career and
  funding strategy. The CIRCUIT → MERIT → COMPASS lineage is
  documented in the peer-reviewed engineering-education literature
  #cite-num(24). Section VII expands on this evidence.

  The second is the *Practice Flywheel*: the iterative cycle
  — *Identify → Activate → Prototype → Analyze → Transition* — that
  has now been demonstrated across multiple LE pilots run by the
  LENS partner team at JHU/APL. Each iteration produces working
  artifacts, sponsor-visible evidence, and curriculum material for
  the next cohort. The flywheel is what prevents the program from
  being a series of unconnected projects and makes it instead a
  compounding institutional asset — each cohort shortening the
  implementation gap for the next. The casebook itself is a
  flywheel artifact: the work of prior cohorts produces the
  reference dataset for the next.

  engineering deliverables produced inside real operational systems.

  the artifact, the measurement instrument that decides if the artifact

  Engineering routinely build artifacts; the cases in this book show
  that the artifacts then need disciplines that those schools are not

  PISTA — the *Perceptual Inference System for Tactical Agentic AI* —
  was a ten-week incubator delivering tactical AI decision support
  for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's chemical, biological,
  radiological, nuclear, and explosives mission. Nine student fellows
  shipped PISTA, drawn from the broader Summer 2025 cohort of
  forty-four students at the JHU/APL AI Pathfinding Lab; all
  forty-four benefited from the shared cohort infrastructure, mentor
  pool, and cross-project collaboration even when working on other
  sponsor problems. The PISTA team delivered a working
  perception-reason-report agentic pipeline on a COTS stack (Gemini
  Flash, GPT-4o, Firebase) with deployed sensors on UGVs and small
  UAS. Three full redesigns inside ten weeks. Live demonstration to
  DTRA leadership. Follow-on funding under exploration. The pilot
  demonstrates the Practice Flywheel at compressed timescale in a
  defense context #cite-num(26).

  No single pilot would settle the LENS proposition. The cumulative
  record is what matters. Across pilots, the same set of LE practices
  recurs: explicit capability requirements; structured pedagogical
  scaffolding; instrumented measurement linked to operational outcomes;
  paired technical and cultural interventions; cohort-based delivery
  with deliberate inheritance of tools and lessons across cohorts; and
  an explicit Identify → Activate → Prototype → Analyze → Transition
  cycle. The same artifacts produced in those pilots — the rubrics,
  the prompts, the dashboards, the after-action reports, the published
  papers — become the curriculum material for the next cohort. The
  program is, in this sense, the institutional flywheel its case
  studies argue every high-consequence domain requires.

  Part I, "The Failure Modes," organizes one hundred cases under six
  recurring patterns: training gap, capability designed out,
  normalization of deviance, interface failure, governance failure, and
  knowledge loss. A seventh chapter — the Evidence Gap — anchors the
  measurement question. The taxonomy is not a theory. It is a finding:
  six categories that account for almost every well-documented case in
  the literature of preventable failure in complex sociotechnical
  systems, and that recur across healthcare, defense, education,
  energy, transportation, and government.

  Part II, "What Works," collects the cases in which the capability
  parameter was engineered rather than left to drift. Every success
  case in the dataset shares a structural feature: a *paired
  intervention.* A technical artifact paired with a cultural authority.
  A measurement instrument paired with a governance body that listens
  to it. A curriculum paired with the institutional architecture to
  sustain it. Neither half alone moves the curve. The pair is
  irreducible. This is the strongest empirical pattern in the book and
  it directly informs the LENS pedagogical commitment to co-optimization
  across technical and human design.

  Part III, "The Frontier," concerns the cases where the discipline is

  human-AI teaming cases that anticipate the next decade of capability
  engineering. The cases are deliberately less settled. The discipline
  is being asked to specify what good looks like before the catastrophe
  arrives. That is the work the program exists to teach.

  how the LENS curriculum addresses the pattern, and reflection
  questions designed for studio discussion. The casebook is built to be
  taught from, read straight through, or consulted as a reference. The
  curriculum crosswalk in the closing matter maps each case to the
  specific courses in the program that use it as a worked example.

  The one hundred cases in this volume are mapped to the LENS courses
  they most directly inform. The distribution is itself diagnostic.
  The strongly covered courses are the ones the existing case
  literature most readily supports: bias and governance (LEN 7) and
  knowledge transfer and organizational learning (LEN 8), each with
  more than forty cases; capability analysis (LEN 5) and evidence
  and measurement (LEN 4), each with roughly thirty; human-AI
  teaming (LEN 2) and foundations (LEN 1), each around twenty.
  These are not arbitrary numbers — they describe a dataset
  saturated with cases of *what goes wrong when ethics, governance,
  evidence, and institutional learning are not engineered.*

  The thin coverage is also informative. LEN 9 (Computational and AI
  Methods) is at ten cases — the dataset has the failure modes of
  algorithmic systems well-represented but the computational tools
  for capability instrumentation under-represented. The capstone
  course (LEN 10) maps to sixteen cases — fewer than the number of
  Studio-style projects we expect each LENS cohort to undertake.
  The newly-renumbered LEN 3 (Learning Engineering Systems) and
  LEN 6 (Applied Problem Solving) required focused retagging to
  reach defensible coverage; the work surfaced that the operational
  systems-engineering content the program teaches in LEN 3 is
  *under-represented in the published case literature* relative to
  its centrality in the curriculum, and that LEN 6's stakeholder-
  analysis and problem-framing work has not historically been
  packaged as case material by other disciplines. These are
  pedagogical gaps the LENS studio sequence (LEN 6 → LEN 10) is
  organized to close — not by adding more failure cases, but by
  having students produce the missing artifacts in real operational
  settings and entering them into the dataset for the next cohort.
