    v(4pt)

    text(font: sans, size: 8.5pt, fill: text-dark)[
      This casebook was assembled using AI tools as part of an
      iterative learning-engineering process — the same Practice
      Flywheel (Identify → Activate → Prototype → Analyze → Transition)
      that the volume's case studies argue for. The methodology
      treats AI as the dual entity the curriculum names it: a
      creative partner that accelerated drafting, cross-referencing,
      layout, and citation lookup, and an epistemic risk that had
      to be hand-checked against the record. Every case in the book
      was reviewed by the editors and hand-checked by students for
      accuracy: confirming that the sources cited exist and are
      findable, that the quoted attributions are fairly represented,
      and that the case studies are accurate accounts of the
      incidents and the investigations they draw on. Items where the
      source could not be confirmed are marked "Paraphrasing…" so
      the attribution is honest about what is the author's
      reconstruction and what is verbatim from the record.

    text(font: sans, size: 8.5pt, fill: text-dark)[
      The volume is not finished. It is the first iteration of a
      reference dataset that LENS will continue to develop. We will
      revise the book based on reader feedback, reviewer findings,
      and our own ongoing practice of learning engineering — adding
      new cases as the operational record grows, correcting our
      record where it can be improved, and updating the curriculum
      crosswalk as the program itself iterates. Corrections, new
      cases, and reader feedback are welcomed.

    text(font: sans, size: 8pt, style: "italic", fill: text-muted)[
      All cases reference publicly reported incidents and published
      investigations. Quoted material is attributed to source
      investigations, court documents, and academic publications.
      Reflection questions are original to this volume. The
      audit record of citations checked and changes made is
      maintained alongside the source repository.

      References to convictions, settlements, and findings reflect
      the public record at the time of writing. Where individuals
      are named, they are named only as participants in
      investigations, court proceedings, or public inquiries
      already in the public domain. The casebook makes no legal
      characterization beyond what those records establish.
