  This book collects one hundred real incidents in which capability —
  what people could or could not do inside a complex system —
  determined whether the system worked. Some are failures: lives
  lost, systems wrecked, billions written off. Some are successes:
  deliberate interventions that engineered capability into the
  architecture of the work. Together they form an evidence base for
  the argument that capability is a designable, measurable property
  of every complex system.

  Each case occupies a two-page spread. The left-hand page tells the story:
  what happened, what investigators found, and the documentary record. The
  right-hand page is the *Learning Engineering Lens* — what the case teaches
  about capability as a system parameter, how the LENS curriculum addresses
  the pattern, and a short set of reflection questions designed for
  studio discussion.

  The Lens page also carries a *Who Builds This* note: the mix of
  expertise and tools a team would bring to engineer the fix, read off
  the case's failure modes. A Training-Gap case pulls in learning
  scientists and instructional designers; an Interface case, human-
  factors and interaction designers; a Governance case, policy, ethics,
  and measurement. Most cases need several at once, held together by
  domain experts and a learning engineer. No single discipline carries
  a case alone — reading the modes as a staffing list is itself a LENS
  skill, and what *you* bring is yours to decide.

      The strongest cases pair a catastrophic failure with a systematic
      capability intervention. Together they show both the cost of the gap and
      the tractability of the solution. The discipline that closes that gap is
      learning engineering.
