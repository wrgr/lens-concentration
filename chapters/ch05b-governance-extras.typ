  summary: [
    The UK Post Office's Horizon accounting system, built by Fujitsu and
    rolled out in 1999, generated phantom shortfalls in sub-postmasters'
    branch ledgers. Rather than accept the software was at fault, the Post
    Office prosecuted them — around 900 over two decades — for theft and
    false accounting; people were imprisoned, bankrupted, and driven to
    suicide, in what is now called the most widespread miscarriage of
    justice in UK history. Internal documents showed engineers had known
    about Horizon bugs throughout. Convictions began to be quashed in 2021,
    and a public inquiry continues. The failure ran through the prosecutor
    and the courts: each accepted "the computer said so" as authoritative
    because no actor had the standing or expertise to challenge it. Horizon
    is the book's case for institutional deference to a flawed algorithm.

    // -- Background --
    [
      The UK Post Office ran thousands of branches through sub-postmasters —
      local operators personally liable for any shortfall in their accounts.
      In 1999 it deployed Horizon, an accounting system built by Fujitsu, to
      track every branch's ledger.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      Horizon produced systematic accounting errors — phantom shortfalls that
      appeared in branch ledgers. The Post Office treated the shortfalls as
      real and the sub-postmasters as thieves: over two decades it prosecuted
      around 900 for theft and false accounting, refusing to accept the
      system itself was at fault. People were imprisoned, lost homes, went
      bankrupt, and some died by suicide.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      Documents later released through litigation showed Fujitsu and Post
      Office engineers had known about Horizon bugs throughout the
      period.#cn() The courts began quashing convictions in 2021, and the
      public inquiry under Sir Wyn Williams found that senior employees
      "knew, or at the very least should have known, that Legacy Horizon was
      capable of error" — establishing it as the most widespread miscarriage
      of justice in UK history.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The gap was at the regulator, the prosecutor, and the courts: each
      accepted Fujitsu's representation that Horizon was reliable, despite
      documentation to the contrary, because no institutional actor had the
      standing or expertise to interrogate it. "The computer said so" became,
      for two decades, a sufficient basis for criminal conviction — the
      governance hazard of treating automated output as authoritative rather
      than as evidence to be challenged.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      Convictions have been overturned — some by an exceptional act of
      Parliament — compensation schemes established, and Fujitsu and the Post
      Office called to account before the continuing inquiry.#cn() Horizon's
      lesson is the chapter's in its bluntest form: an automated system's
      output is not testimony, and any institution that lets "the computer
      said so" stand unchallenged against a human's account has built a
      machine for manufacturing injustice.

      Texas runs its own electric grid under ERCOT, largely outside federal
      reliability jurisdiction — a structure that prized low cost and light
      regulation. Its generators and the gas supply feeding them were built
      for Texas heat, not sustained deep cold, and winterization was not
      required.#cn()

    // -- What Happened --
    [
      In February 2021 Winter Storm Uri drove temperatures far below those
      design assumptions. Gas wells and wellheads froze, gas-fired generation
      — the bulk of the lost capacity — tripped offline, and coal, nuclear,
      and wind also lost output. Over roughly four days ERCOT directed load
      shed, and millions of Texans lost power in rolling blackouts that, in
      many places, did not roll. Officially 246 died; peer-reviewed
      excess-mortality estimates run 700–1,000, with around \$130 billion in
      damage.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The FERC-NERC joint inquiry identified the absence of winterization
      requirements as the proximate capability failure.#cn() And it was no
      surprise: ERCOT and Texas generators had been warned after similar
      cold-weather events in 1989, 2011, and 2014 that winterization was
      inadequate — warnings that never produced a mandate, because the cost
      would pass to consumers and the rare event was judged acceptable.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The Texas freeze is a designed-out capability meeting a changing
      climate. Winterization was treated as optional because the rare event
      was deemed acceptable — but the acceptable rate of the rare event
      changed while the designed-out capability did not. Four warnings across
      three decades did not move the institution, because nothing in its
      structure forced the cost of resilience to be paid before the
      catastrophe rather than after.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      After 2021 Texas finally mandated weatherization of generation and key
      gas facilities, with inspections and penalties behind it.#cn() The case
      sits beside the chapter's other slow-erosion failures: a known,
      repeatedly flagged vulnerability accepted as routine until the
      tolerances aligned — here, with a population-scale death toll the
      warnings had, in effect, predicted.

    The Texas Grid Freeze is the case for designed-out capability under
    changing climate conditions. Winterization was treated as
    optional because the rare event was acceptable. The acceptable
    rate of the rare event changed; the designed-out capability did
    not.

    misses (1989, 2011, 2014) that did not produce remediation.
