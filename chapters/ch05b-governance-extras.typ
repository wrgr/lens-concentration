  body: [
    The Post Office's Horizon IT system, developed by Fujitsu and
    deployed in 1999, produced systematic accounting errors in sub-
    postmasters' branch ledgers. The Post Office prosecuted hundreds
    of sub-postmasters for theft and false accounting on the basis of
    these errors, refusing for two decades to accept that the system
    itself was at fault. Internal Post Office and Fujitsu documents,
    later released through litigation, showed that engineers had known
    about software bugs throughout the period.

    By the time the Court of Appeal began quashing convictions in
    2021, sub-postmasters had served prison sentences, lost homes, and
    been driven to bankruptcy and suicide. The Williams Inquiry, which
    began in 2020 and continues, has documented one of the most
    extensively evidenced institutional cover-ups in UK history.

    The capability gap was at the regulator, the prosecutor, and the
    courts: each accepted Fujitsu's representation that Horizon was
    reliable, despite documentation to the contrary, because no
    institutional actor had the standing or expertise to challenge it.
    The case is the strongest available evidence that "the computer
    said so" is a governance hazard.

  ),
  body: [
    A winter storm in February 2021 brought temperatures across Texas
    well below the design assumptions of ERCOT-operated generation and
    transmission infrastructure. Natural-gas wells froze; gas-fired
    generation (which accounted for the majority of lost capacity)
    tripped offline; coal, nuclear, and wind also lost output. Across
    roughly four days, ERCOT directed load shed and millions of Texans
    lost power in rolling blackouts that, in many cases, did not roll.
    The Texas Department of State Health Services officially recorded
    246 deaths; peer-reviewed excess-mortality analyses estimate
    700–1,000.

    The post-event analyses identified the absence of winterization
    requirements for Texas-grid generators as the proximate capability
    failure. ERCOT had been warned after similar storms in 1989, 2011,
    and 2014 that winterization was inadequate. The Texas regulatory
    architecture had not required winterization because the cost
    would be passed to consumers, and the rare events were judged
    acceptable.

    The Texas Grid Freeze is the foundational case in U.S. grid
    reliability for how a designed-out capability (winterization)
    interacts with a changing climate to produce population-scale
    harm.

    The Texas Grid Freeze is the case for designed-out capability under

    not.
