  body: [
    The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) — the benchmark interest
    rate referenced in approximately three hundred fifty trillion
    dollars of financial contracts — was set daily by a small panel
    of banks submitting estimates of what they would pay to borrow.
    The submission was an estimate, not a verified market rate. For
    roughly a decade, multiple banks systematically manipulated their
    submissions to favor their derivatives positions. The
    coordination was visible in internal trader-and-submitter
    communications later subpoenaed by regulators.

    The capability gap was at the design of the benchmark itself: it
    was an *estimate*, not an *observation*. Banks were asked to
    declare what their borrowing rate would be rather than to report
    transactions that had occurred. The architecture invited gaming.
    The gaming, when it happened, was systematic rather than
    occasional.

    LIBOR has now been replaced by SOFR — the Secured Overnight
    Financing Rate — which is constructed from actual transactions
    rather than estimates. The reform took a decade and required
    coordination across multiple regulators globally.

    Investigation by Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the state's
    Office of Student Achievement, and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
    found that educators at scores of Atlanta Public Schools
    elementary and middle schools had systematically changed
    students' answers on state standardized tests over a period of
    several years. The cheating was organized: principals pressured
    teachers, teachers organized "erasure parties" after testing
    days, and the institutional incentive structure rewarded the
    measurement gaming with bonuses, recognition, and promotions.

    The Beverly Hall era at APS had been celebrated nationally as a
    high-performing urban district. The performance was substantially
    fabricated. The students were not learning; the institution was
    rewarding people for the appearance of learning. The capability
    gap was at the incentive architecture and at the measurement
    audit.

    The case is canonical in U.S. education policy for the harms of
    high-stakes testing without an evidence-audit architecture
    independent of the institution being measured.

    Harry Markopolos delivered to the SEC in 2005 a memorandum titled
    "The World's Largest Hedge Fund is a Fraud," outlining in detail
    why Bernard Madoff's purported returns were mathematically
    impossible. The SEC opened an investigation. The investigation
    concluded that no enforcement action was warranted. Madoff
    continued operating until his sons turned him in three years
    later, when the 2008 financial crisis made redemptions impossible
    to honor. By then approximately sixty-five billion dollars had
    been lost.

    The SEC Inspector General's investigation found that the staff
    assigned to Madoff lacked the expertise to evaluate the technical
    arguments Markopolos had made, that the institutional culture
    had defaulted to "Madoff is a respected industry figure" rather
    than to the evidence, and that multiple complaints across more
    than a decade had been similarly dismissed.

    The Madoff case is canonical in U.S. financial regulation for
    the capability gap between the institution responsible for
    enforcement and the technical evidence that should have triggered
    enforcement.

    The 9/11 Commission's final report identified specific intelligence
    failures across the FBI, CIA, NSA, and other agencies. The CIA had
    information on two of the future hijackers from a January 2000
    meeting in Kuala Lumpur. That information was not shared with the
    FBI. The FBI had identified suspicious flight-training activity in
    Phoenix and Minneapolis in 2001. That information was not
    aggregated. Visa decisions, immigration tracking, watch-list
    architecture — each was operated by a different agency, and the
    handoffs between them required initiative that the institutional
    architecture did not require.

    The 9/11 Commission's framing — that the attacks were a failure of
    *imagination* — has been criticized as understating the structural
    nature of the gap. The intelligence sharing did not happen because
    no institution was responsible for it as a deliverable. The reform
    that followed — the Office of the Director of National
    Intelligence, the National Counterterrorism Center, fusion centers
    — built the institutional architecture that had not existed.

  body: [
    Merck's COX-2 inhibitor Vioxx (rofecoxib) was approved by the FDA
    in 1999 for arthritis pain and prescribed widely. The VIGOR trial
    (results published 2000) reported a five-fold higher rate of
    myocardial infarction in the Vioxx arm versus naproxen — a
    signal that Merck and many readers interpreted as a protective
    effect of naproxen rather than a cardiovascular risk of Vioxx.
    The APPROVe trial (terminated September 2004) ultimately
    established the cardiovascular risk on a placebo comparison and
    triggered withdrawal. The disclosure architecture between Merck's
    internal data, the FDA reviewers, and the prescribing community
    did not surface the magnitude of the cardiovascular risk to a
    decision boundary for nearly four years between VIGOR and APPROVe.

    The Vioxx case is foundational in U.S. drug safety for the gap
    between manufacturer-held adverse-event data and the public-
    health-relevant aggregation of that data. The FDA's Adverse Event
    Reporting System depended on submissions that were structured to
    minimize signal. The institutional capability to detect
    population-level harm in time to prevent it was not adequate to
    the volume of the drug's distribution.

    The reform that followed — REMS programs, the Sentinel Initiative
    — built post-market surveillance infrastructure that did not
    previously exist.
