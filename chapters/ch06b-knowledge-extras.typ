  summary: [
    When NASA returned to heavy-lift rockets in the 2000s, it confronted an
    uncomfortable fact: the institutional capability to build a Saturn V —
    the rocket that sent Apollo to the Moon — had been lost. The drawings
    and documents survived; the practical knowledge of how the components
    were manufactured, tested, and assembled, and why each choice was made,
    had walked out with the workforce that retired by the 1990s. The vehicle
    could be redesigned but not reproduced. Apollo was documented to an
    unprecedented degree, yet the documentation was not the capability: when
    the engineers who built the system left, the system left with them.
    Saturn V is the book's strongest evidence that institutional capability
    lives in people and sustaining practices, not in the artifacts an
    institution leaves behind.
  ],
  sections: (
    // -- Background --
    [
      The Saturn V that launched Apollo to the Moon was, by any measure, one
      of the best-documented engineering programs in history — exhaustive
      drawings, specifications, and test records.#cn() That thoroughness is
      what makes the case bite: the program left behind close to everything a
      successor could ask for on paper, so any later difficulty in rebuilding
      it cannot be blamed on a thin archive but must lie in what the archive
      could not hold.
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      Yet by the early 2000s, as NASA worked the Constellation program, it
      had become apparent that the institutional capability to build a Saturn
      V had been lost. The drawings existed; the practical knowledge of how
      the components were manufactured, tested, and assembled — and why
      particular choices had been made — had walked out with the workforce
      that retired by the 1990s. The vehicle could be redesigned. It could
      not be reproduced.#cn() The distinction is exact: redesign starts from
      requirements and rebuilds the reasoning afresh, while reproduction needs
      the original making-knowledge, and it was that knowledge — not the
      paperwork describing it — that had left with the people who held it.
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The case is canonical for the difference between documentation and
      institutional capability. Apollo's documentation was unprecedented, but
      it captured the *what*, not the tacit *how* — the judgment, the
      workarounds, the undocumented reasons — that lived in the people who
      did the work. When they left, that knowledge was in no archive to
      recover.#cn() A drawing records the decision but not the deliberation
      behind it; the workaround that made a part manufacturable and the reason
      a tolerance was set where it was lived in the doing, and once the doers
      retired there was no document from which to reconstruct it.
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      Saturn V is the strongest available evidence that institutional
      capability is not the same as the artifacts an institution produces.
      Capability lives in people and in the practices that sustain them; a
      library of drawings is a necessary record but not a transferable
      ability. An institution that treats documentation as preservation of
      capability is, quietly, letting the capability expire.#cn() The danger
      is that the archive looks like insurance: its very completeness can
      reassure managers that the capability is safe, so the people and
      practices that actually carry it are allowed to disperse precisely
      because the paperwork seems to stand in for them.
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The lesson reshaped how serious programs think about knowledge
      retention — apprenticeship, continuity of teams, deliberate capture of
      tacit reasoning, and not letting a critical capability rest in a
      handful of soon-to-retire heads.#cn() It pairs with the chapter's other
      memory cases: knowledge, unlike a document, has to be actively kept
      alive, or it is gone in a generation. Each of the retention practices
      addresses the same root cause the Saturn V exposed — that tacit making-
      knowledge transfers only person to person — so apprenticeship and team
      continuity are not nice-to-haves but the actual mechanism by which a
      capability outlives the people who first held it.

    Boeing's Starliner, meant to be the second U.S. commercial crew vehicle

    software errors on its 2019 uncrewed flight, valve corrosion scrubbing a
    2021 launch, and propulsion-system trouble on its 2024 crewed test that
    left two NASA astronauts on the ISS rather than returning them as
    contracted — NASA brought them home on SpaceX months later. GAO and NASA
    reviews found capability erosion across multiple engineering disciplines
    at a contractor whose human-spaceflight record had once been definitive.
    The erosion looks partly generational (Apollo- and Shuttle-era engineers
    retired) and partly institutional (cost and schedule pressure, and the
    thinning of NASA's in-house depth to challenge the contractor). Starliner
    is the contemporary case for capability erosion at a legacy contractor.
  ],
  sections: (
    // -- Background --
    [
      Boeing was awarded a NASA Commercial Crew contract to build Starliner
      as the second U.S. vehicle to carry astronauts to the ISS, alongside
      SpaceX's Crew Dragon — drawing on a human-spaceflight heritage that had
      once been definitive in American aerospace.#cn() The award rested in
      part on that heritage: a contractor with a definitive human-spaceflight
      record was a presumed safe choice, and that presumption is exactly what
      the program would go on to test, since reputation was standing in for a
      current measurement of capability.
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      Instead Starliner stumbled across a decade: software errors marred its
      2019 uncrewed test flight, valve corrosion scrubbed a 2021 launch, and
      propulsion-system problems on the 2024 crewed test flight left the two
      NASA astronauts aboard the ISS rather than returning on the contracted
      spacecraft — NASA brought them home on a SpaceX vehicle months
      later.#cn() The three failures fell in different subsystems across three
      separate years, which is itself telling: a single bad part is bad luck,
      but software, valves, and propulsion failing in succession points to
      something broader than any one component — a decline running across the
      engineering organization rather than within one of its parts.
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      GAO and NASA reviews identified the program as exhibiting capability
      erosion across multiple engineering disciplines — software, valves,
      propulsion, integration testing — at a contractor whose track record
      had previously been definitive.#cn() The erosion looked partly
      generational, as Apollo- and Shuttle-era engineers retired, and partly
      institutional: cost pressure, schedule-driven decisions, and the loss
      of NASA's own in-house engineering depth to challenge the
      contractor.#cn() The two causes compound: as the contractor's senior
      depth thinned through retirement, the buyer's own engineering depth had
      also eroded, so the very expertise NASA would have needed to catch the
      slipping contractor was the expertise it had let go of.
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      Starliner is the contemporary case for capability erosion at scale at a
      legacy contractor. The decline happened over decades and was visible
      only in retrospect, because the institutional architecture for catching
      a supplier's slow capability decay — and updating the buyer's
      confidence to match — did not exist. Reputation outran reality, and no
      instrument was measuring the gap.#cn() Slow decay is the hard case to
      catch: no single year's results look alarming, the brand keeps the
      buyer's confidence high, and without an instrument that tracks the
      supplier's actual current capability the divergence is only legible once
      a crewed flight forces the reckoning.
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      NASA leaned harder on independent reviews and on SpaceX as the reliable
      alternative, and the episode sharpened questions about how to
      sustain — and verify — capability at sole-source and legacy
      suppliers.#cn() It pairs with Saturn V (Case 78): where that case lost
      a capability to retirement, Starliner shows the same erosion in slow
      motion at a living institution still carrying the brand of the
      capability it had let thin. Having a second supplier to fall back on is
      what let NASA absorb the failure, which is itself the lesson: where a
      capability can erode unseen, a verified alternative is the difference
      between an embarrassment and a crew with no way home.

    On its 1996 maiden flight, the Ariane 5 rocket destroyed itself 37

    code from Ariane 4, where a horizontal-velocity value never exceeded a
    16-bit integer's range. Ariane 5's steeper, faster trajectory pushed it
    past that range; the integer overflow crashed both redundant reference
    systems almost simultaneously, the vehicle lost guidance and broke up.
    The inquiry found the offending code path had been irrelevant on Ariane 4
    and was never removed or re-verified for Ariane 5 — software reuse had
    been treated as risk-free. Ariane 5 is the foundational safety-critical-
    software case for the hazard of reusing code without re-verifying it

    [
      The Ariane 5 heavy-lift rocket reused proven components from its
      successful predecessor, Ariane 4 — including, in its inertial reference
      system, software that had flown reliably for years. Reuse of
      flight-proven code was regarded as a way to reduce risk and cost.#cn()
      The reasoning was seductive precisely because the code's flight record
      was genuine: software that had worked on Ariane 4 looked like the
      safest possible choice, and that confidence is what allowed it to cross
      onto a different vehicle without being re-examined against the new
      vehicle's conditions.

    // -- What Happened --
    [
      On 4 June 1996, Ariane 5 Flight 501 — its maiden flight — veered off

      the range-safety system destroyed it, and roughly half a billion
      dollars of payloads were lost.#cn() The vehicle was destroyed in well
      under a minute of flight, before it had done anything but climb — the
      whole half-billion-dollar loss flowing from a fault that triggered
      almost immediately at liftoff, when the new trajectory first pushed the
      inherited code outside the range it had been built to handle.

    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The inquiry board traced the cause to the reused code. A
      horizontal-velocity value that never exceeded a 16-bit signed integer
      on Ariane 4's trajectory did exceed it on Ariane 5's faster one; the
      resulting overflow shut down both redundant inertial reference systems
      almost simultaneously, and the vehicle lost guidance.#cn() Redundancy
      gave no protection here because both units ran the identical inherited
      code and met the identical out-of-range value at the same instant, so
      the backup failed in lockstep with the primary — duplicating a system
      defends against a part breaking, not against a shared assumption being
      wrong. The offending code path had become irrelevant to Ariane 5's
      flight after liftoff, yet had neither been removed nor re-verified
      against the new vehicle's envelope — reuse had been treated as
      risk-free.#cn()

      Ariane 5 is the canonical software-engineering case for the fallacy of
      risk-free reuse. Code is fit for the envelope it was written and
      verified against; reusing it in a different envelope is a new design
      decision and must be re-verified as one. The institutional capability
      that was missing was the requirement that reused safety-critical code
      be re-verified, not merely trusted because it had worked before.#cn()
      The flaw was never in the Ariane 4 code, which was correct for the
      trajectory it was written against; the flaw was the institutional
      assumption that a record of working in one envelope carried over to
      another, an assumption no test was required to challenge.

      Mars Climate Orbiter (Case 54) — small, unexamined assumptions
      inherited across a boundary, fatal when the boundary's conditions
      changed. What unites the three is that each inherited a quantity sound
      in its original setting and lethal in the new one, so the reform is the
      same in every case: make the boundary crossing the moment the
      assumption is re-checked, rather than the moment it is silently trusted.

    // -- Background --
    [
      The Tacoma Narrows Bridge, opened in July 1940 across Puget Sound, used
      a slender, shallow deck chosen for elegance and economy over an earlier
      proposal for a deeper, stiffer stiffening truss. It was sound by the
      design knowledge of its day.#cn() The choice was a deliberate trade of
      a deeper, stiffer truss for a slimmer, cheaper, more elegant deck — and
      every analysis the discipline then had to bring to bear judged the
      result safe, which is what makes the collapse a failure of the available
      knowledge rather than of the calculation.
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      On 7 November 1940, in a wind of only about 40 mph — well within what
      the bridge was designed for — the deck began to twist in growing
      oscillations until it tore itself apart and fell into the sound. The
      piers held and the cables held; the deck destroyed itself.#cn() That the
      piers and cables survived is the diagnostic detail: the structure did
      not fail where engineers knew to look but in the slender deck, and not
      under an extreme load but in an ordinary wind the bridge was expressly
      built to withstand, which is why the cause lay outside what could then
      be calculated.
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The failure mode was aeroelastic flutter — a wind-driven,
      self-amplifying oscillation — that had not been recognized as a design
      hazard for long-span suspension bridges. The bridge had not been
      designed against the thing that destroyed it because that thing was not
      yet known to the discipline.#cn() Because the oscillation fed on itself,
      a modest steady wind could pump ever more energy into the slender deck
      until it tore apart — a self-amplifying mechanism nothing in the era's
      static load analysis was equipped to anticipate, so no competent
      designer of the day would have thought to check for it.
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      Tacoma Narrows is the canonical case of a failure that was not the
      engineer's fault but the discipline's not-yet-knowing. The missing
      capability lived above any individual: a body of knowledge that did not
      yet include flutter. It is the rarer, more hopeful kind of capability
      gap — the one a profession can close by learning, rather than one a
      single institution failed to manage.#cn() The distinction matters for
      how the gap is closed: a failure of management is fixed by holding an
      institution to what was already known, whereas a failure of the
      discipline's knowledge can only be fixed by the whole profession
      learning something it did not previously have.
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      And the profession did learn: wind-tunnel testing of deck sections
      became standard, aeroelasticity entered the curriculum, and the
      collapse film became a permanent teaching artifact. No comparable
      bridge has failed in the same mode since.#cn() The case is the book's
      strongest evidence that discipline-level learning across an entire
      profession is possible — and, set against the recurrence in
      Challenger/Columbia (Case 6), a reminder of how rare it is to absorb a
      lesson that completely. The reform worked because it lodged the new
      knowledge in the field's permanent machinery — a required test, a
      curriculum topic, a teaching film every student sees — rather than in
      the memory of the engineers who happened to witness it.

  summary: [
    In October 2015 a well at SoCalGas's Aliso Canyon underground gas-storage
    field ruptured and could not be capped for nearly four months, releasing
    roughly 100,000 tons of methane — the largest such leak in U.S. history,
    equivalent to the annual emissions of half a million cars — and forcing
    the evacuation of about 8,000 households in Porter Ranch. The root-cause
    analysis found external corrosion of the well casing, a subsurface safety
    valve removed in the 1970s and never replaced, and a pattern of deferring
    integrity checks on the field's aging wells. The operator knew the wells
    were old and their integrity uncertain; so did the regulator; the
    inspection regime had not been engineered to catch the failure mode that
    occurred. Aliso Canyon is the book's case for legacy infrastructure aging
    past its oversight.

  sections: (
    // -- Background --
    [
      SoCalGas's Aliso Canyon facility stores natural gas underground in
      depleted oil wells, some dating to the 1950s. Over decades the field's
      wells aged while the regime for inspecting them did not keep pace — and
      a subsurface safety valve on the well that would fail had been removed
      in the 1970s and never replaced.#cn() Storing high-pressure gas in wells
      first drilled for oil decades earlier meant the assets were being asked
      to do a job their age had not been qualified for, while the one piece of
      equipment that might have contained a downhole failure had been gone for
      forty years without replacement.
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      In October 2015 well SS-25 ruptured and could not be capped for nearly
      four months. About 100,000 tons of methane vented to the atmosphere —
      the largest such leak in U.S. history, roughly the annual greenhouse
      emissions of half a million cars — and some 8,000 households were
      evacuated from the Porter Ranch neighborhood.#cn() That it took nearly
      four months to cap a single well is its own measure of the gap: the
      failure was not only unprevented but, once underway, beyond the
      operator's ready means to stop, so the release ran on and the evacuation
      of the Porter Ranch households stretched across the whole period.
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The Blade Energy root-cause analysis identified external corrosion of
      the well casing as the failure — a known, inspectable mode the operator
      had not adequately inspected.#cn() It also found missing safety
      equipment and an institutional pattern of deferring integrity checks on
      the older wells; SoCalGas knew the field's wells were aging and their
      integrity uncertain, and so did the regulator.#cn() External corrosion
      was not an exotic or unforeseeable mode but a familiar one with an
      established inspection technique, so the failure turned on the deferral
      itself: the pattern of putting off integrity checks on the oldest wells
      meant the very inspections that existed to catch corrosion were the ones
      not being done.
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      Aliso Canyon is the case for legacy infrastructure aging past the
      inspection regime designed for it. The wells were older than the
      regulations governing them; the operator knew, the regulator knew, and
      the capability deliverable to update the inspection regime to the
      assets' actual engineering condition did not exist. Knowledge of the
      risk was present everywhere except in the rules that would have acted
      on it.#cn() The gap was therefore not one of awareness but of
      translation: everyone holding the knowledge that the wells were past
      their safe life lacked the mechanism to convert that knowledge into a
      mandatory, updated inspection, so the awareness sat inert until the well
      ruptured.
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The leak prompted tighter California rules for underground gas
      storage — required inspections, pressure limits, and risk-management
      plans — and a long fight over the field's future. The lesson pairs with
      the chapter's other memory failures: an institution can hold the
      knowledge that an asset is past its safe life and still not act, until
      the rules that translate knowledge into inspection are themselves
      rebuilt. Each of the new requirements addresses a specific part of the
      failure — inspections for the uninspected corrosion, pressure limits for
      the overtaxed old wells, risk plans for the deferral pattern — which is
      what it looks like to rebuild the rules so that knowledge of an aging
      asset is finally forced into action.
