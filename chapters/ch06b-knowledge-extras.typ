  body: [
    By the early 2000s, when NASA was working on the Constellation
    program, it had become apparent that the institutional capability
    to build a Saturn V rocket had been lost. Drawings existed.
    Documents existed. But the practical knowledge — the institutional
    memory of how the components were manufactured, tested, and
    assembled, and what choices had been made and why — had walked out
    with the workforce that had retired by the 1990s. The vehicle
    could be redesigned. It could not, by 2005, be reproduced.

    The case is canonical in U.S. aerospace for the difference between
    documentation and institutional capability. The Apollo program was
    documented to an unprecedented degree. The documentation was not
    the institutional knowledge. When the engineers who had built the
    system left, the system left with them.

    The Saturn V case is the strongest available evidence that
    institutional capability is not the same as the artifacts the
    institution produces. The lesson is general: capability lives in
    people and in the institutional practices that sustain them, not
    in the documents the institution leaves behind.

  body: [
    Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, intended as the second commercial
    crew vehicle alongside SpaceX's Crew Dragon, suffered software
    errors in its 2019 uncrewed test flight, valve corrosion
    requiring a 2021 launch scrub, and propulsion-system issues during
    its 2024 crewed test flight that left the two NASA astronauts
    aboard the International Space Station rather than returning on
    the contracted spacecraft. NASA returned the astronauts on
    SpaceX vehicles months later.

    The Government Accountability Office and multiple NASA internal
    reviews identified the Starliner program as exhibiting capability
    erosion across multiple engineering disciplines — software, valves,
    propulsion, integration testing — at a contractor whose human-
    spaceflight track record had previously been definitive in U.S.
    aerospace. The erosion appears to be partly generational (Apollo-
    and Shuttle-era engineers retired) and partly institutional (cost
    pressures, schedule-driven decisions, and the loss of NASA's
    in-house engineering depth to challenge the contractor).

    Starliner is the contemporary U.S. aerospace case for capability
    erosion at scale at a legacy contractor.

    The inertial reference system software on Ariane 5 Flight 501
    inherited code from Ariane 4. On Ariane 4, a particular variable —
    a horizontal velocity value — never exceeded the range of a 16-bit
    signed integer. On Ariane 5, with its different flight trajectory,
    the value did. The integer overflow caused both redundant inertial
    reference systems to shut down almost simultaneously. The vehicle
    lost guidance, broke up under aerodynamic stress, and was
    destroyed by the range safety officer.

    The inquiry board found that the code path producing the overflow
    had been disabled by Ariane 4's mission profile but had not been
    removed when the software was reused for Ariane 5. The capability
    that was missing was the requirement that reused code be re-
    verified against the new vehicle's flight envelope. Software
    reuse was treated as risk-free; it was not.

    Ariane 5 is the foundational case in safety-critical software
    engineering for the hazards of code reuse without re-verification.

    The Tacoma Narrows Bridge across Puget Sound collapsed on November
    7, 1940, in a wind no stronger than the bridge had been designed
    for. The failure mode — aeroelastic flutter — had not been
    recognized as a design hazard in long-span suspension bridges.
    The bridge's slender deck, chosen for aesthetic reasons over
    Ammann's earlier proposal of a deeper truss, was the proximate
    cause. The pier was sound. The cables were sound. The deck
    twisted itself apart in a wind no stronger than a stiff breeze.

    Tacoma Narrows is the canonical case in engineering pedagogy for
    a failure mode the discipline had not yet learned to recognize.
    The cost of the lesson — captured on film and shown to virtually
    every undergraduate civil engineer since — was a bridge. The
    payoff is that no comparable bridge has collapsed in the same
    mode since. The engineering discipline updated.

    The case is also a foundational example of the way disciplines
    learn from individual failures and incorporate the lesson into
    pedagogy permanently.

    greenhouse emissions of half a million cars. Eight thousand
    households were evacuated from Porter Ranch.

    The Blade Energy investigation identified corrosion in the well's
    casing, missing safety equipment that had been installed and then
    removed in the 1970s, and an institutional pattern of deferring
    integrity checks on the older wells in the field. SoCalGas had
