  summary: [
    When NASA returned to heavy-lift rockets in the 2000s, it confronted an
    uncomfortable fact: the institutional capability to build a Saturn V —
    the rocket that sent Apollo to the Moon — had been lost. The drawings
    and documents survived; the practical knowledge of how the components
    were manufactured, tested, and assembled, and why each choice was made,
    had walked out with the workforce that retired by the 1990s. The vehicle
    could be redesigned but not reproduced. Apollo was documented to an
    unprecedented degree, yet the documentation was not the capability: when
    the engineers who built the system left, the system left with them.
    Saturn V is the book's strongest evidence that institutional capability
    lives in people and sustaining practices, not in the artifacts an
    institution leaves behind.

  sections: (
    // -- Background --
    [
      The Saturn V that launched Apollo to the Moon was, by any measure, one
      of the best-documented engineering programs in history — exhaustive
      drawings, specifications, and test records.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      Yet by the early 2000s, as NASA worked the Constellation program, it
      had become apparent that the institutional capability to build a Saturn
      V had been lost. The drawings existed; the practical knowledge of how
      the components were manufactured, tested, and assembled — and why
      particular choices had been made — had walked out with the workforce
      that retired by the 1990s. The vehicle could be redesigned. It could
      not be reproduced.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The case is canonical for the difference between documentation and
      institutional capability. Apollo's documentation was unprecedented, but
      it captured the *what*, not the tacit *how* — the judgment, the
      workarounds, the undocumented reasons — that lived in the people who
      did the work. When they left, that knowledge was in no archive to
      recover.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      Saturn V is the strongest available evidence that institutional
      capability is not the same as the artifacts an institution produces.
      Capability lives in people and in the practices that sustain them; a
      library of drawings is a necessary record but not a transferable
      ability. An institution that treats documentation as preservation of
      capability is, quietly, letting the capability expire.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The lesson reshaped how serious programs think about knowledge
      retention — apprenticeship, continuity of teams, deliberate capture of
      tacit reasoning, and not letting a critical capability rest in a
      handful of soon-to-retire heads.#cn() It pairs with the chapter's other
      memory cases: knowledge, unlike a document, has to be actively kept
      alive, or it is gone in a generation.

    Boeing's Starliner, meant to be the second U.S. commercial crew vehicle

    at a contractor whose human-spaceflight record had once been definitive.

      Starliner is the contemporary case for capability erosion at scale at a

      a supplier's slow capability decay — and updating the buyer's

      a capability to retirement, Starliner shows the same erosion in slow
      motion at a living institution still carrying the brand of the

    On its 1996 maiden flight, the Ariane 5 rocket destroyed itself 37

    code from Ariane 4, where a horizontal-velocity value never exceeded a
    16-bit integer's range. Ariane 5's steeper, faster trajectory pushed it
    past that range; the integer overflow crashed both redundant reference
    systems almost simultaneously, the vehicle lost guidance and broke up.
    The inquiry found the offending code path had been irrelevant on Ariane 4
    and was never removed or re-verified for Ariane 5 — software reuse had

      The inquiry board traced the cause to the reused code. A
      horizontal-velocity value that never exceeded a 16-bit signed integer
      on Ariane 4's trajectory did exceed it on Ariane 5's faster one; the
      resulting overflow shut down both redundant inertial reference systems

  le-insight: [
    Aliso Canyon is the case for legacy infrastructure aging past the
    inspection regime designed for it. The wells were older than the
    inspection regulations. The operator knew. The regulator knew.
    The capability deliverable to update the inspection regime did
    not exist.

    LENS uses Aliso Canyon in LEN 7 for regulatory-architecture
    capability and in LEN 8 for the institutional pattern of legacy
    assets aging past the regime governing them.
