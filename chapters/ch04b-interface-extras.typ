    On 29 December 1972 an Eastern Air Lines L-1011 descended into the
    Florida Everglades on a night approach to Miami, killing 101 of the 176
    aboard. The cause was attention, not mechanics: all three flight-deck
    crew became absorbed in a landing-gear indicator bulb that had failed to
    light, and while they worked it, the autopilot's altitude hold was
    inadvertently disengaged. The aircraft sank slowly; an altitude alert
    chimed but went unheeded in the cockpit clutter, and no one was
    monitoring the flight path. The NTSB findings launched decades of
    research into attention, monitoring, and cockpit-alert design, and the
    accident is a formative event behind Crew Resource Management. Eastern
    401 is the canonical case of a low-priority task crowding out a
    life-critical one.

      The crew noticed that the landing-gear indicator light had not
      illuminated, and all three focused on the bulb. While they worked the
      problem, one of them inadvertently nudged the controls and disengaged
      the autopilot's altitude hold. The TriStar began a slow descent into
      the Everglades; an altitude-warning chime sounded but, in the auditory
      clutter of the cockpit, no one registered it. The aircraft hit the
      swamp, killing 101 of the 176 aboard.#cn()

      difficulty that they failed to monitor the flight path.#cn() The
      findings inaugurated decades of research into attention, monitoring,
      and the design of cockpit alerts — the accident is cited in nearly
      every introductory cognitive-engineering course as the example of how a
      low-priority task can crowd out a life-critical one when attention is
      undivided among the available channels.#cn()

    // -- The Capability Gap --

      The missing capability was a designed division of attention across the
      crew, and an alert that carried the priority its message deserved.
      Three competent people attended to a burned-out bulb while no one
      watched the altitude; the chime existed but did not cut through. The
      flight deck had the people and the information — it lacked the design
      that would have kept one channel of attention on the thing that could
      kill them.#cn()

      Eastern 401 was one of the formative events behind Crew Resource
      Management (Case 12) — the explicit allocation of monitoring and
      cross-checking roles — and behind modern standards for prioritized
      cockpit alerting.#cn() Its lesson is that attention is a designable
      parameter, not a personal virtue: a system that lets all eyes converge
      on one task must guarantee the critical channel is still watched.

    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The technical signal existed — the platform was not ready, and people
      knew it. But the decision authority sat at the executive layer, where
      the signal arrived weakened by passage through intermediate layers, and
      the institutional architecture gave the technical layer no way to halt
      the migration. The missing capability was not testing knowledge but a
      governance structure in which a "not ready" could stop a scheduled
      go-live.#cn()

    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      TSB rebuilt its testing and migration governance, paid out and was
      penalized, and the case entered the literature as a study in
      technical-decision authority.#cn() It is the financial-sector analog of
      Healthcare.gov (Case 10): a large migration shipped without the testing
      the institution knew it needed, because schedule pressure overrode a
      technical signal that had no authority to win.

  le-insight: [
    TSB is the canonical case for schedule pressure overriding
    technical signal in a regulated industry. The technical signal
    existed. The decision authority was at the executive layer where
    the signal arrived weakened by passage through multiple intermediate
    layers. The institutional architecture did not allow the technical
    layer to halt the migration.

    LENS uses TSB in LEN 7 as a corporate-governance case and in
    LEN 8 for the institutional structure of technical-decision
    authority. Studio projects compare TSB and Healthcare.gov.
