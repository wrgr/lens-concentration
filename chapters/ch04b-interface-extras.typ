  title: "Eastern Air Lines Flight 401",
  year: "1972",
  domains-list: ("aviation",),
  modes-code: "HT",
  impact: "101 killed in the Everglades; the entire flight crew fixated on a landing-gear indicator bulb while the autopilot silently disengaged",

    caption: "Eastern 401 — three crew, one task, no monitor",
  ),
  body: [
    Approaching Miami at night, the crew of Eastern 401 noticed that
    the landing-gear indicator light had not illuminated. All three
    flight-deck members focused on the bulb. While they worked the
    problem, one of them inadvertently disengaged the autopilot
    altitude hold. The L-1011 descended slowly into the Everglades.
    The crew did not notice. The altitude warning chime sounded —
    according to the CVR — but in the auditory clutter of the cockpit
    no one heard it as significant.

    The NTSB findings inaugurated decades of research into attention,
    monitoring, and the design of cockpit alerts. The accident is
    cited in virtually every introductory cognitive-engineering
    curriculum as the canonical example of how a low-priority task
    can crowd out a life-critical one when attention is undivided
    among the available channels.

    Eastern 401 was one of the formative events that led to the
    development of Crew Resource Management (Case 12) and to modern
    standards for cockpit alerting systems.

    Eastern 401 is the canonical attention-failure case. The capability
    that was missing was a designed division of attention across the
    crew. CRM exists because Eastern 401 happened, and the discipline
    of cockpit alert design exists because the altitude warning chime
    did not carry the priority weight it needed to.

    LENS uses Eastern 401 in LEN 5 to teach attention as a designable
    parameter and in LEN 2 to introduce alert prioritization as a
    capability deliverable. The case anchors the CRM origin story.

    caption: "737 rudder — the failure mode certification did not anticipate",
  ),
  body: [
    Two Boeing 737s crashed unrecoverably from level flight after the
    rudder Power Control Unit reversed: pilot inputs produced rudder
    movement in the opposite direction. The NTSB investigation took
    years, partly because the failure mode was both rare and unrecoverable.
    The eventual finding identified a thermal shock condition in the
    rudder servo valve — cold soaked hydraulic fluid striking a hot
    valve under specific operational conditions — combined with a
    secondary valve design that, when jammed, allowed the rudder to
    move opposite to commanded input.

    The capability gap was specifically that the pilots had no
    procedure for recognizing or recovering from a rudder reversal.
    The Aircraft Operating Manual did not anticipate the failure.
    Crew training did not include it. The aircraft itself, in the
    failure mode, was not recoverable by any flight-control input
    available to the crew.

    The 737 rudder cases sit at the intersection of mechanical design,
    certification testing, and crew capability — all three would have
    had to fail simultaneously for the accidents to occur, and all
    three did.

    The 737 rudder cases are the case for an unrecoverable
    operational state hidden inside an apparently working system. The
    capability gap was not in the pilots — there was no capability
    that would have recovered the aircraft. The gap was in the
    certification process that had not surfaced the failure mode and
    in the maintenance procedures that did not test for it.

    case (when no human action is recoverable, capability engineering
    must move upstream) and in LEN 7 for certification governance.

  body: [
    On July 19, 2024, CrowdStrike pushed a content update to its Falcon
    endpoint sensor that contained a logic error in a small
    configuration file. On every Windows machine running the affected
    sensor version, the file caused the kernel driver to dereference
    an out-of-bounds pointer and crash. The blue-screen-of-death loop
    that followed required manual recovery on each affected machine.
    Eight and a half million machines simultaneously, across hospitals,
    airlines, banks, and government agencies worldwide, became
    unusable.

    The case is the largest IT outage in history measured by economic
    impact. CrowdStrike's own post-incident report identified that the
    content update had not been validated against the same set of
    automated tests as code updates, and that the staged-rollout
    practice CrowdStrike used for code did not extend to content. The
    capability that was missing was the assumption that content is
    treated identically to code from a deployment-safety standpoint.

    The case is the cybersecurity-vendor analog of Knight Capital
    (Case 55) at a scale six orders of magnitude larger.

    The CrowdStrike outage is the live case for what happens when a
    deployment safety architecture treats categories of artifact
    differently than the operational system actually does. Content

    different in the deployment pipeline. The mismatch became the

  body: [
    On the night of September 26, 1983, the Soviet Oko early-warning
    satellite system reported the launch of five U.S. Minuteman ICBMs
    toward the Soviet Union. The duty officer at Serpukhov-15,
    Lt. Col. Stanislav Petrov, was responsible for verifying the alert
    and reporting it up the chain. Petrov assessed the signal as a
    false alarm — a real first strike, he reasoned, would involve
    hundreds of missiles, not five — and reported it as such. He was
    correct. The signal had been generated by sunlight reflecting off
    high-altitude clouds at a particular geometry against the Oko
    satellite's infrared sensors.

    Petrov's decision is widely credited with averting nuclear war.
    The case demonstrates both the necessity and the fragility of
    human-in-the-loop capability for nuclear command-and-control. The
    automation had failed in a mode its designers had not anticipated.
    The human in the loop had the contextual judgment and the
    institutional protection to override the alert.

    Subsequent investigations identified the satellite-geometry failure
    mode and modified the algorithm. The case is permanently archived
    in early-warning training as the canonical false-positive scenario.

    TSB Bank attempted to migrate five million customer accounts from

    came back online, virtually every component of the new platform
    had problems. Customers saw other people's accounts. Mortgages
    disappeared. Card payments failed. The recovery took months.

    The Slaughter and May independent investigation found that the
    migration had been tested under conditions that did not approximate
    real customer load, that the new platform had been certified ready
    by a process that did not adequately challenge the certification,
    and that the executive decision to proceed had been taken against
    technical recommendations that the platform was not ready. The
