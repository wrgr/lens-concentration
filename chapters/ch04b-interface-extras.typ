    On 29 December 1972 an Eastern Air Lines L-1011 descended into the
    Florida Everglades on a night approach to Miami, killing 101 of the 176
    aboard. The cause was attention, not mechanics: all three flight-deck
    crew became absorbed in a landing-gear indicator bulb that had failed to
    light, and while they worked it, the autopilot's altitude hold was
    inadvertently disengaged. The aircraft sank slowly; an altitude alert
    chimed but went unheeded in the cockpit clutter, and no one was
    monitoring the flight path. The NTSB findings launched decades of
    research into attention, monitoring, and cockpit-alert design, and the
    accident is a formative event behind Crew Resource Management. Eastern
    401 is the canonical case of a low-priority task crowding out a
    life-critical one.

    // -- Background --
    [
      Eastern Air Lines Flight 401, a wide-body Lockheed L-1011, was on a
      night approach to Miami on 29 December 1972 with a full flight deck —
      captain, first officer, and flight engineer.#cn() Three crew was the
      era's safeguard against any one person being overloaded, the assumption
      being that more eyes meant more coverage; the night would show that
      without a designed division of those eyes, three people could converge
      on a single trivial problem as easily as one.
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      The crew noticed that the landing-gear indicator light had not
      illuminated, and all three focused on the bulb. While they worked the
      problem, one of them inadvertently nudged the controls and disengaged
      the autopilot's altitude hold. The TriStar began a slow descent into
      the Everglades; an altitude-warning chime sounded but, in the auditory
      clutter of the cockpit, no one registered it. The aircraft hit the
      swamp, killing 101 of the 176 aboard.#cn() The descent was gentle
      enough to go unfelt, and the single chime carried no more urgency than
      the routine sounds around it — so the one cue that could have broken the
      fixation was indistinguishable, by design, from the background it
      sounded against.
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The NTSB found the crew had become so engrossed in the landing-gear
      difficulty that they failed to monitor the flight path.#cn() A
      burned-out indicator bulb had absorbed the attention of an entire
      qualified crew while a wide-body airliner descended unwatched — the
      disproportion
      between the trigger and the outcome is exactly what made the case so
      durable a teaching example. The
      findings inaugurated decades of research into attention, monitoring,
      and the design of cockpit alerts — the accident is cited in nearly
      every introductory cognitive-engineering course as the example of how a
      low-priority task can crowd out a life-critical one when attention is
      undivided among the available channels.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The missing capability was a designed division of attention across the
      crew, and an alert that carried the priority its message deserved.
      Three competent people attended to a burned-out bulb while no one
      watched the altitude; the chime existed but did not cut through. The
      flight deck had the people and the information — it lacked the design
      that would have kept one channel of attention on the thing that could
      kill them. Attention had been treated as something the crew would
      naturally allocate well, rather than as a resource the cockpit had to
      be built to protect, and that unexamined assumption was the gap.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      Eastern 401 was one of the formative events behind Crew Resource
      Management (Case 12) — the explicit allocation of monitoring and
      cross-checking roles — and behind modern standards for prioritized
      cockpit alerting.#cn() Both reforms encode the same correction: CRM
      assigns someone to keep flying the aircraft while others troubleshoot,
      and prioritized alerting ensures the most dangerous condition is the
      loudest one — turning the night's two failures into permanent
      structural defenses. Its lesson is that attention is a designable
      parameter, not a personal virtue: a system that lets all eyes converge
      on one task must guarantee the critical channel is still watched.

    Two Boeing 737s fell out of controlled flight when their rudders

    Colorado Springs in 1991 (25 killed) and USAir 427 near Pittsburgh in
    1994 (132 killed), 157 in all. The NTSB investigation took years because
    the failure was rare and unrecoverable. It traced the cause to a
    thermal-shock condition in the rudder's power-control-unit servo valve —
    cold-soaked hydraulic fluid hitting a hot valve — that could jam the
    valve and reverse the rudder. The pilots had no procedure to recognize
    or recover the failure; the manuals and training never anticipated it,
    and in that state no available control input could save the aircraft.
    The 737 rudder cases are the book's case for an unrecoverable failure
    mode hidden inside a working aircraft.
  ],
  sections: (
    // -- Background --
    [
      The Boeing 737, the most-produced jetliner in history, steers in yaw
      with a rudder driven by a hydraulic power control unit (PCU). The PCU's
      servo valve was a dual-concentric design intended to be fault-tolerant
      — a reassuring assumption that had passed certification.#cn() Because
      the design was believed to be fault-tolerant, a single jam was treated
      as something the redundant geometry would contain; that confidence is
      precisely what let the failure mode hide in plain sight across a fleet
      flying millions of hours without incident.
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      Twice, 737s rolled and dove out of level flight unrecoverably: United
      Airlines Flight 585 near Colorado Springs in 1991 (25 killed) and USAir
      Flight 427 near Pittsburgh in 1994 (132 killed) — 157 deaths between
      them. In each, the rudder had swung hard over, opposite to what the
      crew commanded.#cn() A control that moves opposite to its input is the
      cruelest failure a pilot can face: every corrective action deepens the
      upset, and the three years separating the two losses meant the first
      crash yielded no usable answer in time to protect the second.
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The NTSB investigation took years, because the failure was both rare
      and unrecoverable, leaving little to reconstruct.#cn() An unrecoverable
      event tends to destroy its own evidence, and a rare one offers no
      pattern to work from, so the board had to reason toward a mechanism the
      wreckage could only hint at. It eventually
      identified a thermal-shock condition in the rudder servo valve —
      cold-soaked hydraulic fluid striking a hot valve under specific
      conditions — that could jam the secondary valve and let the rudder move
      opposite to commanded input, a convergence of cold, heat, and timing so
      narrow it had eluded every test the design had been put through.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The gap was not in the pilots: in the failure mode no control input
      available to them could recover the aircraft, and they had no procedure
      even to recognize a rudder reversal, because the manuals and training
      never anticipated it. The missing capability sat upstream — in a
      certification process that had not surfaced the failure mode, and
      maintenance procedures that did not test for it. When no human action
      is recoverable, capability engineering must move to the design and
      certification, not the cockpit — no amount of pilot skill or training
      can close a gap that lives in a part the crew cannot reach and a state
      no procedure names, which is why the only real fix was upstream of the
      flight deck entirely.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      Boeing redesigned the rudder PCU and the fleet was retrofitted, and the
      cases reshaped how rare, unrecoverable failure modes are hunted in
      certification and flight test.#cn() Retrofitting the entire fleet
      conceded that the original fault-tolerant assumption had been wrong,
      and the changed approach to certification testing accepted that a part
      passing its tests is not the same as a part proven safe across every
      condition it will meet. The 737 rudder sits at the
      intersection of mechanical design, certification testing, and crew
      capability — all three would have had to fail together for the
      accidents to occur, and all three did.

      CrowdStrike's Falcon sensor runs deep inside Windows — in the kernel —
      to detect threats, and it updates constantly: not only its code, but
      "content," the rapid-response detection configuration pushed to
      customers continuously. The deployment pipeline treated that content as
      a lighter category than code, with less testing and no staged
      rollout.#cn() The distinction had a logic: content shipped fast and
      often, precisely so the sensor could keep pace with new threats, and
      slowing it down with full code-grade testing seemed to defeat its

      deployment pipeline — content treated as safer than code — that did not
      match the operational reality, in which a bad content file could crash
      the kernel exactly as bad code could. The boundary was an organizational

      trusted the vendor's deployment safety, and that trust turned out to be
      load-bearing for the operation of a large slice of the global economy
      on a single morning. Each customer had implicitly outsourced a safety
      gate to the vendor's pipeline, so the one missing gate inside that

      On the night of 26 September 1983 Oko reported a U.S. intercontinental
      ballistic missile launch — then, minutes later, four more, for five in
      all. Lt. Col. Stanislav Petrov, the duty officer, assessed the signal
      as a false alarm — a genuine first strike, he reasoned, would involve
      hundreds of missiles, not five — and reported it as such. He was
      correct.#cn() The reasoning that saved the situation came from outside
      the system entirely: Oko could report what it saw, but it could not weigh
      five launches against the doctrine of a real first strike, and that
      mismatch between the alert and the strategic picture was exactly the
      judgment the machine had no way to make.
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The cause was an unanticipated automation failure: sunlight reflecting
      off high-altitude clouds at a particular geometry had fooled the Oko
      satellite's infrared sensors into reading launches that were not
      there.#cn() It was a failure of the rarest kind — a benign natural
      phenomenon the sensors had never been designed to discount — which is
      precisely why no automated check existed to catch it. Later investigation identified the satellite-geometry
      failure mode and modified the algorithm; the scenario is now
      permanently archived in early-warning training as the canonical false
      positive, a permanent reminder that the system's worst error was one
      it could not have flagged for itself.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The automation had failed in a mode its designers had not imagined, and
      no automated check could catch it. What caught it was a human with the
      contextual judgment to weigh the alert against what a real attack would
      look like, and the institutional latitude to override the system rather
      than simply relay it. Petrov's "funny feeling" was a career's worth of
      judgment doing the work the automation could not — and crucially, the
      chain of command had left him room to act on it rather than forcing him
      to pass the alert upward unfiltered, so the recoverability lived as much
      in the authority structure as in the man.#cn()

    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      Petrov's decision is widely credited with averting nuclear war, and the
      case is permanently studied in command-and-control training.#cn()
      Preserving the episode in training is itself a design choice: it keeps
      the failure mode and the human override alive as institutional memory,
      so the lesson does not erode the way the original sensor's blind spot
      had. It is
      the book's strongest argument that retaining a human in some loops is
      capability engineering, not nostalgia: the human role is the
      recoverability of an automation failure the designers did not
      anticipate — which is exactly why fully automating a strategic decision
      removes the one element that can catch the unimagined error.

    In April 2018 TSB Bank tried to migrate some five million customer
    accounts off its former parent Lloyds' systems onto a new platform from
    its current owner, Sabadell, over a single weekend. When services came
    back online, nearly every component failed: 1.9 million customers were
    locked out, some saw strangers' accounts, mortgages vanished, payments
    bounced. Recovery took months and cost over £330 million; the CEO
    resigned and the regulator fined the bank. The independent review found
    the platform had been tested under conditions that did not approximate
    real load, certified ready by a process that did not challenge the
    certification, and pushed live against technical recommendations that it
    was not ready. TSB is the financial-sector analog of Healthcare.gov: a
    migration shipped without adequate testing because schedule pressure
    overrode the technical signal.

  sections: (
    // -- Background --
    [
      TSB Bank, spun out of Lloyds and acquired by Spain's Sabadell, needed
      to move some five million customer accounts off Lloyds' systems onto a
      new Sabadell-built platform. The cutover was scheduled for a single
      weekend.#cn() Compressing a five-million-account migration into one
      weekend left no room for partial failure: the schedule itself became a
      forcing function, framing readiness as a date to be hit rather than a
      condition to be proven, and that framing would later prove decisive
      when the technical signal said the platform was not ready.
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      When customer-facing services came back online that Sunday evening in
      April 2018, nearly every component of the new platform had problems.
      About 1.9 million customers were locked out; some saw other people's
      accounts, mortgages disappeared, and card payments failed. The recovery
      took months, cost more than £330 million in compensation and
      remediation, and the chief executive resigned.#cn() That nearly every
      component failed at once points away from a single defect and toward a
      platform that had never been exercised under real load — the kind of
      systemic breakdown that follows when a system is proven only in
      conditions it will never actually meet.
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The Slaughter and May independent review found the migration had been
      tested under conditions that did not approximate real customer load,
      and that the platform had been certified ready by a process that did
      not adequately challenge the certification — a certification that
      confirmed readiness rather than interrogating it, which is how a system
      that would fail under real conditions could be signed off as fit.#cn()
      Decisively, the
      executive decision to proceed had been taken against technical
      recommendations that the platform was not ready; the Financial Conduct
      Authority later fined TSB, treating the override of a known technical
      objection as a failure of governance and not merely of engineering.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The technical signal existed — the platform was not ready, and people
      knew it. But the decision authority sat at the executive layer, where
      the signal arrived weakened by passage through intermediate layers, and
      the institutional architecture gave the technical layer no way to halt
      the migration. The missing capability was not testing knowledge but a
      governance structure in which a "not ready" could stop a scheduled
      go-live. Knowing a system is unready is worthless if the knowledge
      cannot reach the decision with its force intact and the authority to
      act on it; here the truth was present but powerless.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      TSB rebuilt its testing and migration governance, paid out and was
      penalized, and the case entered the literature as a study in
      technical-decision authority.#cn() Rebuilding governance rather than
      merely the platform was the right diagnosis: the failure had been one
      of who could say "stop" and be heeded, so the durable fix had to live
      in the decision structure rather than the code. It is the financial-sector analog of
      Healthcare.gov (Case 10): a large migration shipped without the testing
      the institution knew it needed, because schedule pressure overrode a
      technical signal that had no authority to win.
