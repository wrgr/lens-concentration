    In 1982, seven people in the Chicago area died after taking Tylenol
    capsules laced with potassium cyanide. Not knowing who was responsible
    or how widespread the tampering was, Johnson & Johnson recalled every
    Tylenol product nationwide — 31 million bottles, at a cost of roughly
    \$100 million — suspended advertising, and engaged openly with the FBI
    and FDA. The response was unprecedented in U.S. corporate practice, and
    it was a direct application of the J&J Credo, written in 1943, which
    had pre-specified that the company's first responsibility was to its
    customers. The reform that followed reshaped consumer packaging
    worldwide — tamper-evident seals and blister packs — and the FDA issued
    tamper-resistant-packaging rules within months. Tylenol recovered its
    market share within a year.

    [
      Johnson & Johnson's corporate Credo, written in 1943, pre-specified
      that the company's first responsibility was to the patients and
      consumers who used its products, ahead of shareholders. For four
      decades it was a statement of values; in 1982 it became an
      operational decision rule under extreme pressure.#cn()

    // -- The Intervention --
    [
      After seven people in the Chicago area died from Tylenol capsules
      laced with potassium cyanide, and with the source and scope of the
      tampering unknown, Johnson & Johnson recalled every Tylenol product
      nationwide — about 31 million bottles, at a cost near \$100 million —
      suspended all advertising, and engaged publicly with the FBI and FDA
      rather than minimizing exposure.#cn()
    ],
    // -- How It Worked --
    [
      The load-bearing element was a commitment pre-committed in writing.
      Because the Credo had already decided, decades earlier, that the
      customer came first, the 1982 leadership did not have to improvise an
      ethical calculus under crisis — it executed a pre-made decision. CEO
      James Burke later credited the Credo with making clear "exactly what
      we were all about" the moment the deaths occurred.#cn()

    // -- The Evidence --
    [
      The response, unprecedented in U.S. corporate practice, preserved
      public trust: Tylenol recovered its market share within a year
      despite the enormous short-term cost. The case became the canonical
      positive example in business education of crisis response driven by
      capability commitment rather than legal minimization.#cn()

      The reform reshaped consumer-product packaging worldwide —
      tamper-evident seals, blister packs, and caplet forms became standard
      — and the FDA promulgated tamper-resistant-packaging regulations
      within months. The deeper transfer is the principle that values must
      be pre-committed in writing to be operational under stress, not
      invented in the moment.#cn()

    The Aviation Safety Reporting System, run by NASA on behalf of the FAA

    mechanics, and cabin crew about incidents, near-misses, and safety
    concerns. Its load-bearing feature is institutional, not technical:
    reporting an event to ASRS confers immunity from FAA enforcement for
    the conduct reported, within specified limits, making honest reporting
    the rational choice. Over nearly fifty years and more than two million
    reports, ASRS has become the world's largest repository of
    aviation-safety information, surfacing patterns — automation surprise,
    runway incursions, fatigue effects — before they reached formal
    investigation thresholds. The architecture has been emulated across

      The most valuable safety information in any high-consequence domain
      lives with front-line operators — the near-misses and quiet errors
      that never reach an accident report. But operators will not surrender
      that information to an institution that can punish them for it, so
      the data that could prevent the next accident stays locked in the
      people who hold it.#cn()

    // -- The Intervention --
    [
      In 1976 the FAA and NASA created the Aviation Safety Reporting
      System, a confidential channel for pilots, controllers, mechanics,
      and cabin crew to report incidents, near-misses, and concerns. NASA —
      not the regulator — administers it, and reporting an event confers
      immunity from FAA enforcement for the conduct reported, subject to
      specified limits.#cn()

    [
      The system pairs a technical artifact (the reporting form and a
      searchable database) with a cultural commitment (protected,
      non-punitive use). The immunity provision makes reporting the
      rational choice for the operator, and NASA's role as a neutral third
      party makes the protection credible. Either half alone fails;
      together they make the data flow to the institution that can act on
      it.#cn()

    Through whistleblowing and a public inquiry, the Bristol Royal

    times — located the capability gap in the absence of routine
    specialty-level outcomes reporting: surgeons did not know how their
    results compared with peers, patients did not know, and referrals did
    not respond to actual outcome data. The reform built national
    specialty-level outcomes registries, first in cardiac surgery and then
    across other specialties, making the UK one of the few countries that
    routinely publishes surgeon-level results — a paired intervention of
    technical registry plus institutional commitment to publish that ended
