  summary: [
    The Boeing 737 MAX was a re-engined 737 meant to fly without new pilot
    training — the commercial promise that sold it against the Airbus
    A320neo. Its bigger engines changed the jet's pitch behavior, so Boeing
    added software (MCAS) to mask the difference, then kept it out of the
    manuals and training and let it fire on a single angle-of-attack sensor.
    When that sensor failed on Lion Air 610 (2018) and Ethiopian 302 (2019),
    MCAS forced the nose down and crews who had never heard of it could not
    recover; 346 people died and the fleet was grounded. Investigations
    found the training omission was deliberate, to avoid certification cost.
    The MAX is the book's inverse case: human capability engineered out of a
    system to save the price of sustaining it.
  ],
  sections: (
    // -- Background --
    [
      The 737 MAX was Boeing's answer to the Airbus A320neo: a re-engined
      version of its best-seller that airlines could fly without retraining
      pilots on a new type. But the MAX's larger, forward-mounted engines
      changed how it pitched, so Boeing added software — MCAS — to make it
      handle like the older 737s, papering over an aerodynamic change with a
      control law so the airframe would feel identical from the cockpit. The
      whole commercial logic depended on that software staying invisible: the
      less of a "new function" MCAS seemed, the less the MAX would trigger
      costly new training, and the lower the airline's switching cost away from
      the A320neo. Boeing reportedly promised Southwest a rebate of about a
      million dollars per jet if simulator training proved necessary — a clause
      that turned the training requirement into a direct line on the program's
      ledger.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      To keep MCAS in the background, it was left out of the manual and
      training, and allowed to fire on a single angle-of-attack sensor with
      no second source to cross-check it. When that sensor
      failed on Lion Air Flight 610 in October 2018, MCAS repeatedly forced
      the nose down; the crew, never told the system existed, fought it cycle
      after cycle until the jet dove into the Java Sea, killing all 189. Five
      months later Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 repeated almost exactly the
      same sequence, killing 157 — 346 dead across the two crashes, and the
      entire MAX fleet grounded worldwide.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The investigations made the decisions legible. Internal 2013 minutes
      showed employees noting that calling MCAS a new function would bring
      "greater certification and training impact" — the cost the program was
      built to avoid, written down years before either crash; a 2016 survey
      found 39% of certification staff felt undue pressure. The House
      Transportation Committee's 2020 report concluded Boeing's assumption that
      simulator training was unnecessary "diminished safety, minimized the
      value of pilot training, and inhibited technical design improvements,"
      naming the omission as a choice rather than an oversight.#cn() The DOT
      Inspector General traced how the single-sensor design and the training
      omission passed through a certification process that delegated much of
      the safety judgment back to Boeing itself, so the company effectively
      reviewed its own most consequential trade-offs.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The MAX inverts this book's usual case. Human capability was not
      overlooked by accident; it was deliberately engineered out to avoid the
      cost of the training that would have created it. The pilots were not undertrained by
      oversight but by design — the absence of training was, in effect, a
      contract deliverable promised to customers and protected by a rebate.
      Seen that way, the crashes are not a training failure that befell a good
      airplane but exactly what the commercial and engineering decisions
      specified: a flight-control system that depended on pilots reacting
      correctly, in seconds, to a failure they had been guaranteed never to
      learn about.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The MAX was grounded for some twenty months. MCAS was redesigned to use
      both sensors, fire once, and with limited authority — restoring the
      margins the original had stripped away.
      The FAA's 2020 return-to-service required the simulator training the
      airplane had been built to avoid, and Congress tightened the FAA's
      oversight of the delegation system that had let Boeing self-certify so
      much of the design.#cn() The reform conceded the point the program had
      spent years resisting: the training was a real requirement all along,
      and removing it from the paperwork only deferred the cost — and then
      moved it onto two airplanes full of people.

    The Therac-25, a radiation-therapy machine, massively overdosed at
    least six patients between 1985 and 1987, killing at least three. Its

    firing without its target in place; to save cost, the Therac-25 removed
    them and trusted software — adapted from the older machines and never
    engineered for safety — to keep the beam modes separated. A race
    condition let a fast operator trigger the full beam with no target,
    while the console showed only a meaningless "Malfunction 54." Leveson
    and Turner's 1993 investigation, the founding case of software-safety
    engineering, found a systemic failure: a safeguard removed with nothing
    put in its place. The lesson — a safeguard you delete does not remove
    the hazard; it relocates it to whatever you failed to build.
  ],
  sections: (
    // -- Background --
    [
      The Therac-25 was a radiation-therapy linear accelerator. Its
      predecessors used hardware interlocks that physically blocked the
      high-energy beam unless the spreading target was confirmed in place — a
      mechanical backstop that could not be talked out of stopping the beam.
      To save cost and simplify the machine, the Therac-25 removed them and
      trusted software — adapted from the older machines and never engineered
      from the ground up for safety-critical use — to keep its two beam modes,
      a hundredfold apart in energy, safely separated. The safety case
      migrated silently from steel to code.#cn()

    // -- What Happened --
    [
      Between 1985 and 1987 the machine massively overdosed at least six
      patients. A race condition the engineers never knew about meant that
      if an operator entered a prescription, caught a mistake, and corrected
      it within about eight seconds — the speed an experienced operator
      naturally reaches — the full-power beam could fire with no target in
      place, delivering up to a hundred times the intended dose. The console
      showed only "MALFUNCTION 54," a code with no documented meaning, and
      offered to proceed; operators, assured the machine was safe and long
      accustomed to its cryptic faults, did. At least three patients died of
      the radiation burns.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      When patients reported searing pain, the manufacturer first insisted
      an overdose was impossible and treated each report as an isolated
      complaint rather than a signal. Nancy Leveson and Clark Turner's 1993
      investigation — the founding case study of software-safety engineering
      — found the fault was systemic rather than a single bug: overconfidence
      in software, removal of the hardware safeguards without replacement,
      meaningless error messages, reused code never audited for safety, no
      independent review of the safety-critical logic, and an
      incident-reporting posture that dismissed the early warnings instead of
      compounding them into evidence.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The hardware interlock had not been redundant; it *was* the safety
      case, the one thing standing between a typing error and a lethal dose.
      Removing it put nothing in its place — no verified software check, no
      informed operator action, no independent monitor watching the beam. The
      operator stayed nominally in the loop but lost any means to detect what
      the machine was doing wrong, since the only feedback was a code that
      told them nothing, which made the human presence a formality rather than
      a safeguard. The question capability engineering would have forced —
      *what function now carries the interlock's load?* — was never asked of
      the redesign.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      Therac-25 reshaped safety-critical software practice, making the case
      by counterexample for independent hazard analysis, safeguards that do
      not all rest on the same software, error messages that say what is wrong
      so the operator can act, and treating field reports as evidence to be
      aggregated rather than complaints to be closed. It remains the canonical
      teaching case across software, medical-device, and systems-safety
      curricula.#cn() Its lesson is exact and portable: a safeguard you remove
      does not remove the hazard it guarded — it relocates the hazard to

    demanded, the radar's range gate was off by a third of a second — enough
    to look in the wrong place. Israeli operators had flagged the drift two
    weeks earlier, and a patch reached Dhahran the day after the strike. The

    // -- Background --
    [
      The Patriot was built to defend Western Europe against Soviet aircraft
      in engagements of minutes — switched on, fired, switched off, then moved
      before it could be targeted. In the 1991 Gulf War it was doing something
      else: defending fixed sites in Saudi Arabia against ballistic missiles,
      in batteries left running continuously for more than a hundred hours
      because the threat came without warning and could not be scheduled. The
      mismatch between the original concept of operations and the new use was
      real, and invisible to the operators, because no one had told them the
      machine had been built around an assumption they were now violating.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      The system tracked time in a 24-bit fixed-point register, and a tiny
      rounding error — invisible in any short engagement — accumulated with
      every hour of uptime. After about a hundred hours the timing was off by
      roughly a third of a second, which seems negligible until it is
      multiplied by a ballistic missile's speed: enough for the radar's range
      gate to look in the wrong place and reject the real track as noise. On
      25 February 1991 an incoming Scud arrived where the Patriot was no
      longer searching, passed unengaged, and struck a barracks in Dhahran,
      killing twenty-eight soldiers of the 14th Quartermaster Detachment and
      wounding about a hundred.#cn()

    // -- The Investigation --

      The drift was not unknown: Israeli operators had flagged it two weeks
      earlier from their own sustained use, and engineers had a patch already
      in hand — which reached Dhahran the day after the strike, too late to
      matter.#cn() The only field mitigation was an advisory to reboot after
      "very long" run times, never defining "very long," so a crew could obey
      the instruction to the letter and still drift into the danger band. The
      General Accounting Office found the Army had simply presumed no one would
      run a battery continuously for so long, and so never treated the
      accumulating error as a hazard worth specifying or warning against.#cn()

      The capability to hold accuracy under sustained operation was never
      built in, because the original concept of operations did not require
      it — a defensible omission for the system as first imagined, fighting in
      short bursts and moving on. The failure came when the concept changed
      and the assumption did not travel with it. Nothing carried the design's
      hidden premise forward to the soldiers in Dhahran; no artifact, briefing,
      or warning told them "this system was built assuming you would turn it
      off." The system did not malfunction — it did exactly what it was built
      to do; the transition between operating contexts did, with nothing in

      of the vague advisory, and the defect — a fixed-point truncation error
      growing without bound as uptime increased — became a staple of
      numerical-analysis and software-engineering teaching.#cn() The harder
      lesson is the one this chapter turns on: a capability quietly assumed
      away at design time does not announce itself when the context shifts. It
      waits, intact and invisible, until the day the assumption is wrong — and
      by then the people relying on the system have no way to know the ground
      has moved beneath them, because the premise was never written where they

    from engineering to operations — and why, here, it arrived a day late.

  approaches: (
    during: (
      [Make every load-bearing design assumption — here, that the system would be cycled off — an explicit, recorded requirement so a later change of use cannot silently violate it.],
      [Bound numerical error over the full intended operating envelope, including run times far beyond the original concept, rather than only the durations first imagined.],
      [Design the system to detect and bound its own accumulating drift, degrading or warning before the error reaches a magnitude that defeats the mission.],
    ),
    after: (
      [Issue concrete, testable operating limits — exact reboot intervals, not "very long" — derived from the design data and propagated to every crew.],
      [Establish a path for field reports of anomalous behavior, like the Israeli warning, to reach engineering and trigger fleet-wide action faster than a patch can lose a race with the threat.],
      [Require a capability-transition review whenever a system is redeployed to a new concept of operations, surfacing which original assumptions the new mission breaks.],
