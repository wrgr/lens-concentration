  ),
  body: [
    Ford engineers identified the Pinto's rear-impact fuel-tank
    vulnerability during pre-production testing. An eleven-dollar
    modification — a polyethylene shield between the tank and the
    differential — would have largely eliminated the failure mode.
    Internal cost-benefit calculations, later subpoenaed by Congress,
    found the modification more expensive than the projected wrongful-
    death settlements and chose not to implement it. The calculation
    was not secret to its authors; it was secret only to the public
    and to Pinto buyers.

    The Pinto case became the founding case study in U.S. engineering
    ethics curricula. It is the most direct documentary evidence in the
    industrial dataset of a manufacturer pricing human life against an
    engineering change and choosing against the change. The lawsuits
    that followed produced the largest punitive damages of the era and
    contributed to the modern regulatory consumer-protection regime.

    The capability that was designed out of the Pinto was the
    capability to survive a rear-impact crash. The reason it was
    designed out was institutional, not technical.

    The Pinto is the canonical Designed-Out case in industrial

  body: [
    Takata's ammonium-nitrate-based airbag inflators were designed
    without the desiccant that competitors used to stabilize the
    propellant against humidity and temperature cycling. Under hot,
    humid conditions over years of use, the propellant degraded; on
    deployment, the inflator could rupture and send metal fragments
    into the cabin. Takata's internal documents, later subpoenaed,
    showed engineers had raised the concern repeatedly. The company's
    own testing data showed the failure. The data was reported to
    regulators as anomalous rather than as a class.

    The recall — when it finally came — covered more than a hundred
    million inflators across nineteen automakers and remains the
    largest in automotive history. Takata filed for bankruptcy. The
    parent company was sold. The death count continues to rise as
    older affected vehicles remain in service.

    The desiccant was the capability that was designed out. The reason
    was cost. The fact that competitors used it was visible to anyone

  body: [
    A faulty ignition switch in several GM compact-car models could
    rotate from "run" to "accessory" while driving, disabling power
    steering, power brakes, and — critically — the airbag system. GM
    engineers identified the problem in 2002 and approved a fix in
    2006 *without changing the part number*, meaning the fix did not
    propagate as a recall would have. Cars with the faulty switch
    continued to be built and sold. The internal practice of changing
    a part without changing the part number violated GM's own
    engineering standards. Internal investigations later called it
    "the GM nod" and "the GM salute."

    The Valukas Report commissioned by GM after the recall identified
    cultural patterns at the company that suppressed escalation of
    safety issues. Mary Barra, who became CEO during the recall, used
    the report as the basis for the company's restructuring of safety
    decision-making.

    The capability that was designed out of GM was the institutional
    pathway by which a safety problem reached the decision to recall.

    The GM ignition switch case is the canonical example of a corporate

  body: [
    Lockheed Martin's ground software produced thrust outputs in
    pound-force seconds. NASA's navigation system expected newton-
    seconds. The unit conversion was not performed at the interface. As
    a result, every trajectory correction the spacecraft executed was
    off by a factor of about four and a half. The Mars Climate Orbiter
    arrived at Mars on a trajectory that took it too close to the
    planet's surface. It burned up in the atmosphere.

    The Mars Climate Orbiter Mishap Investigation Board found no
    individual fault. The fault was a missing interface specification
    between two contractors and an institutional review process that
    had not caught the gap. Both contractors had done their internal
    jobs correctly; the boundary between them was the missing
    deliverable.

    The case is canonical in software engineering for what happens
    when interface specifications are treated as documentation rather
    than as engineering deliverables.

    On the morning of August 1, 2012, Knight Capital deployed a
    software update to seven of eight servers in its order routing
    system. On the eighth, dead code from a previous release that had
    never been removed was still active. When the new flag was set in
    a configuration file, the dead code began executing buy orders at
    a rate of millions of shares per second. Knight's loss reached one
    hundred seventy-two million dollars in the first forty-five minutes
    of trading. By close, the loss exceeded four hundred forty million
    dollars. The firm was acquired within months.

    The SEC investigation found that Knight's deployment procedure did
    not include a verification step to confirm that all eight servers
    held identical code. The dead code was a Chekhov's gun left in the
    repository years earlier — a function that had been retired but
    not removed. The flag that triggered it was repurposed for a
    different feature without auditing what else still listened to it.
