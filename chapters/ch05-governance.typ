  summary: [
    inBloom was a \$100-million, Gates-funded shared data infrastructure for
    U.S. student records — and the technology worked: no bug, no breach, no
    performance failure. What killed it in about fourteen months was
    everything around the technology. It launched without consent
    frameworks, community engagement, transparency about data use, or a way
    for parents to participate in decisions about their children's data.
    Parent-privacy groups organized opposition state by state, and nine
    states withdrew. Analysts read inBloom as the failure of technocratic
    reform — the assumption that technically sound infrastructure generates
    its own legitimacy. It is the purest governance failure in the dataset,
    and the book's clearest argument that in education at scale, stakeholder
    trust and governance are not optional features but load-bearing
    structure.

    // -- Background --
    [
      inBloom was an ambitious shared data infrastructure for U.S. K-12
      student records, backed by \$100 million from the Gates Foundation,
      hosted on commercial cloud, and built by enterprise engineers. The
      premise was that a common store would spare districts from rebuilding
      the same plumbing and let applications interoperate across systems that
      had never spoken to one another. Technically it was sound — no bug, no
      breach, no performance failure ever undid it, and that very soundness is
      what makes the case instructive.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      What undid it was everything around the technology. inBloom launched
      without adequate consent frameworks, without meaningful community
      engagement on data governance, without transparency about what was
      collected and why, and without any way for parents to participate in
      decisions about their children's data. Each omission read, to a worried
      parent, as a decision made about their child without them in the room.
      Parent groups organized opposition state by state, and nine states —
      among them New York, Louisiana, and Illinois — withdrew as the political
      cost of staying overtook any promised efficiency. Within about fourteen
      months the \$100-million initiative collapsed.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      Analysts at Data & Society read inBloom as the failure of technocratic
      education reform: the assumption that technically sound infrastructure
      generates its own legitimacy proved catastrophically wrong. Legitimacy,
      on this reading, is earned from the stakeholders a system acts upon, not
      conferred by the quality of its engineering. The technology was never
      the problem; the governance was — the consent, transparency, and trust
      that had been treated as add-ons rather than as the foundation the whole
      effort needed before a single record moved.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      inBloom is the purest governance failure in this dataset: nothing
      technical was wrong, and everything sociotechnical was. The missing
      capability was the design of stakeholder trust — consent,
      accountability, and a voice for the families whose data was at stake —
      treated as a precondition for deployment rather than a feature to add
      later. Once opposition formed, no patch could retrofit the trust that
      should have been built in from the start, because trust withheld at
      launch cannot be engineered back in under fire. In education at scale,
      those are load-bearing elements, not optional ones.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      inBloom's collapse set back shared education-data infrastructure for
      years and became a standard cautionary tale; it also helped drive a
      wave of state student-data-privacy laws that codified, after the fact,
      the consent and transparency the project had skipped.#cn() The lesson
      the book takes from it is that ethics-as-design-constraint is not
      ideology but engineering — and inBloom is the \$100-million empirical
      test of what happens when you skip it, paid not in downtime but in a
      dead initiative and a chilled field.

  summary: [
    When Healthcare.gov launched on 1 October 2013 it collapsed under load
    it had never been tested for — about 27,000 enrollments through the
    federal marketplace in its first month against a seven-million first-year
    target. The people assembled to build it knew insurance
    markets and government programs but not technology product launches; key
    technical roles went unfilled, no office clearly owned the integration
    (CMS thought the contractor CGI was the lead integrator; CGI did not),
    and no end-to-end test was run before launch. The fix-it team that
    rescued the site became the U.S. Digital Service. At root it was a
    capability mismatch at scale: the organization lacked the human
    capabilities the system required, and the governance chain surfaced no
    signal of the gap before launch. It is the rare governance failure that
    produced lasting institutional reform.
  ],
  sections: (
    // -- Background --
    [
      Healthcare.gov was the federal insurance marketplace at the center of
      the Affordable Care Act — a high-visibility online system that millions
      would hit on day one, with a political deadline that could not slip. The
      people assembled to build it understood insurance markets and large
      government programs, but not the launch of a consumer technology product
      at that scale, and key technical positions went unfilled — so the very
      expertise the launch most needed was the expertise the team most
      lacked.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      There was no clear division of responsibility among the many government
      offices involved; CMS believed the contractor CGI was the lead system
      integrator, and CGI did not share that understanding — so the single
      most important role on the program was one no party believed it held.
      No end-to-end test was run before launch, meaning the assembled pieces
      were never exercised together as a user would exercise them. The site
      went live on 1 October 2013 and immediately collapsed under load it had
      never been validated for: about 27,000 enrollments through the
      federal marketplace in its first month against a seven-million
      first-year target.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      Reviews by the GAO and the HHS Inspector General found that no single
      person had a clear understanding of the project's status, and that the
      governance chain had no signal that would surface the readiness gap
      before launch. With ownership diffused across offices and no integration
      test to fail, the chain could report progress at every level while the
      whole remained untested — a structure in which bad news had nowhere to
      enter and no one positioned to act on it.#cn()

    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      Healthcare.gov is a capability failure wearing a technology costume.
      The site was salvageable in weeks once the right people arrived, which
      is the clearest proof that the code was never the binding constraint;
      the original failure was that the wrong people had been assembled, and
      that the governance chain meant to catch the mismatch had no mechanism
      to see it. The missing capability was the matching of human capability
      to system requirement — and the institutional signal that would have
      flagged its absence before a deadline locked the launch in place.#cn()

    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The rescue effort pulled together the team that became the U.S. Digital
      Service — a permanent institution born from a failure visible on the
      news every night, its mandate built directly from what the launch had
      lacked.#cn() It is the rare case in this book of a governance failure
      that produced durable organizational reform, and a reminder that the
      technical narrative ("the website crashed") often hides the real one:
      the wrong capability was assembled, unnoticed, by a chain that had no
      way to notice.

    [
      Union Carbide's pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, stored methyl
      isocyanate (MIC) — an extraordinarily toxic intermediate — in bulk,
      holding a lethal hazard in tanks beside a populated city. By 1984 the
      plant was running under heavy cost pressure: understaffed, with several
      key safety systems out of service for months, and workers inadequately
      trained to handle an MIC emergency or read its warning signs. Each

      On the night of 2–3 December 1984, water entered an MIC storage tank
      and triggered a runaway reaction; the safety systems that should have
      contained it were non-operational, so the one event the plant existed to
      prevent met no working barrier on its way out. About forty tons of gas
      vented over the sleeping city. Thousands died within hours; estimates of
      total deaths run to 15,000–20,000, and roughly half a million people

      element, and the U.S. Chemical Safety Board would later find ineffective
      employee training an underlying cause in nine of its first twenty-three

      was accountable for the whole. Because the erosion was spread across
      layers, no single inspection or metric saw it, and each degraded layer
      made the next one matter more. The capability to operate an
      extraordinarily hazardous process safely had been hollowed out by
      cost-cutting, and the governance that should have caught the hollowing
      did not exist to ask whether the whole was still safe.#cn()

    cladding fire whose risks earlier incidents had already shown. The

      combustible aluminium-composite material — installed despite safety

      inspection incompetence, training gaps, and lost institutional memory

      Summit Learning was a personalized-learning platform developed by
      Summit Public Schools with technical and financial support from the
      Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, offered free to U.S. districts from 2015 —
      a price that lowered the bar to adoption while raising no governance
      questions at the door. Its pedagogy — competency-based progression,
      self-directed projects, mentor check-ins — was defensible and in many
      places effective, which is why the eventual revolt could not be blamed
      on the instructional design.#cn()

    // -- What Happened --
    [
      By 2018 the platform reached roughly 380 schools and an estimated
      80,000 students, scaling fast on the strength of a free offer and a
      well-funded sponsor. By 2019 its most visible adopters were withdrawing
      under parent and student pressure: Brooklyn's MS 442 ran an organized
      opt-out; districts in Cheshire, Kennebunk, and McPherson cancelled or
      scaled back after parent meetings where the unanswered governance
      questions surfaced all at once. Walkouts and complaints about screen
      time, eye strain, disengagement, and data privacy converged into a
      revolt that was not about the instructional design at all.#cn()

      Press coverage and later analyses located the failure in deployment
      governance, not pedagogy: there was no evaluation framework a district
      could read before adopting, no parent-facing data-handling agreement,
      and no exit pathway that did not depend on the vendor's goodwill — three
      absences that each became a grievance the moment families looked for
      them. The implementation never surfaced the governance questions parents
      would ask, so when those questions arrived they arrived as opposition
      rather than as design input, and the argument was lost before it
      started.#cn()

      architecture — consent, evidence, measurement, exit — had not been
      engineered alongside it. A working tool with no accountability contract
      is a liability waiting for the first organized objection. The pattern
      recurs across the ed-tech dataset (inBloom, Case 8): a well-intentioned
      tool, a well-funded rollout, and no institutional contract with the
      families and teachers operating inside it — the same omission producing

      concrete: an adoption decision should have to produce a public evidence
      summary at parent reading level, a data-handling agreement at the same

      a tool's deployment legitimate, not just its design sound, and that turn

      The Tennessee Voluntary Pre-Kindergarten Program served roughly 18,000
      four-year-olds a year. Demand exceeded supply, and that scarcity created
      an ethical lottery — a fair way to ration scarce seats that doubled as a
      clean randomizer. It let Vanderbilt's Peabody Research Institute run
      something rare in education: a randomized controlled trial, following

      enroll, the kind of design rarely available in a live policy setting.#cn()

      Through kindergarten the pre-K children showed the expected gains —
      stronger letter knowledge, vocabulary, early literacy — exactly the
      early result the program had been funded to produce. By third grade the
      gains had faded. By sixth grade, the researchers reported, the pre-K
      children were doing somewhat *worse* than the control group on several

      rather than interrogating it. Other rigorous programs — Perry Preschool,
      Abecedarian — remain durable, so the lesson is not that pre-K fails; it
      is that a discipline met an unwelcome, well-measured answer and mostly
      looked away, treating the inconvenient evidence as an attack to repel

      grades — which tend to run optimistic — it built an algorithm to
      "standardize" them against each school's historical performance, on the

      its present cohort.#cn()

      High-achieving students at historically low-performing state schools
      were systematically capped by their school's past results; small-cohort
      private-school students, by contrast, kept their predicted grades
      because small classes escaped the standardization. The pattern fell

      Analysts identified the trap quickly: the algorithm assumed schools
      that had historically underperformed — often for reasons of funding,
      not student capability — would continue to, and used that assumption to
      suppress individual grades, so a student's result was decided partly by
      who had attended their school in prior years. It encoded structural
      inequality and amplified it at national scale in a single release.#cn()

      design, not a surprise it sprang. The mathematics was no mystery; what
      was absent was any process with the authority to ask whether the result
      was just before it was applied to hundreds of thousands of students, and

      algorithm that distributes life-shaping outcomes is a governance

    rest, with irregular work, were misclassified as overpaid. Roughly a
    million debt notices went out, about 470,000 of them later found wholly
    or partly unlawful, with the burden of proof reversed onto recipients
    and no human review. The scheme was linked to deaths, including
    suicides. A 2023 Royal Commission found it sustained by "venality,

    // -- Background --
    [
      From 2016 the Australian government sought to automate welfare-debt
      recovery, drawn by the promise of recovering money at a fraction of the
      administrative cost. Its Robodebt scheme compared recipients' welfare
      records against annual tax data, averaging income evenly across the year
      to estimate overpayments — and issuing debts on that basis at scale,
      replacing the individual case review the work had previously required.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      The averaging assumed stable, year-round employment, which fit only
      about 7% of recipients; the other 93%, with irregular
      work, were misclassified as overpaid — so the assumption at the core of
      the method was wrong for almost everyone it touched. Roughly a million
      debt notices were issued, default judgments raised without human review,
      and the burden of proof reversed onto recipients to disprove debts the
      government had invented, demanding records many of the poorest could not
      produce. The scheme was linked to deaths, including by suicide.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      A 2023 Royal Commission found the scheme unlawful and sustained by
      "venality, incompetence and cowardice," with ministers failing to
      ensure it was lawful before unleashing it on a million people.#cn()
      Analysts noted the algorithm was "comparatively simple" and its harms
      "entirely predictable from the outset" — meaning no technical advance
      was needed to foresee them, only the will to look; about 470,000 debts
      were found wholly or partly unlawful, and a class action settled for
      A\$1.8 billion, with debts zeroed or refunded plus interest, the public
      paying back what the automation had wrongly taken.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      Robodebt is the canonical case of full automation without a human in
      the loop and without lawful basis. The algorithm was not sophisticated
      and the harm was not technical: the scheme survived four years because
      the governance architecture treated automation as an efficiency
      mechanism rather than a decision regime requiring accountability,
      legality, and a path to contest. Calling it "automation" disguised that
      every notice was still a government decision to take money from a
      citizen. Reversing the burden of proof onto the citizen was a governance
      choice, not a coding one, made by people who could have chosen
      otherwise.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The debts were zeroed and refunded, the settlement paid, and the Royal
      Commission's findings referred for further action; "Robodebt" entered
      Australian political memory as a byword for automated administrative
      harm, a label now reached for whenever a new scheme proposes to
      automate a consequential decision.#cn() Its lesson is exact: a
      government decision that takes money from people is a decision, however
      it is computed — and automating it does not relieve the state of the
      duty to make it lawfully, reviewably, and with the burden of proof where
      the law puts it, because the duty attaches to the decision, not to the
      method.

  kind: "failure",
  summary: [
    Most U.S. public colleges now use predictive analytics to flag "at-risk"
    students for early support. Research finds these models carry racial
    calibration bias: they miscalibrate by race in ways that can misclassify
    Black and Latinx students — and so misdirect the very support the
    prediction is meant to trigger. The magnitude depends heavily on how
    "at-risk" is defined, making this partly a construct-definition problem:
    the choice of what to predict is itself a capability decision with equity
    consequences. The models inherit historical patterns of discrimination
    from their training data, and a "flag" can confirm a biased instructor's
    low expectations rather than prompt help. It is the educational analog of
    the UK A-level case — an algorithm built to do good that can allocate
    help away from the students who need it most.
  ],
  sections: (
    // -- Background --
    [
      Colleges increasingly use predictive analytics to identify students at
      risk of failing or dropping out, so advisors can intervene early — a
      genuinely well-meant aim, to reach struggling students before they
      vanish. A large majority of U.S. public colleges now use some form of
      these models, which makes any bias they carry a quiet, system-wide
      feature of how support is allocated rather than an isolated experiment.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      The intervention is well-intentioned, but research finds the models
      carry racial calibration bias: they miscalibrate by race in ways that
      can misclassify Black and Latinx students relative to their actual
      outcomes — and so misdirect the support the flag is meant to trigger,
      turning a tool built to help into one that can steer help away.
      Crucially, the magnitude of the bias depends on how "at-risk" is
      defined, which makes it partly a construct-definition problem rather
      than a coding bug — a flaw in what the model was asked to predict, not
      in how it computes the prediction.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      Researchers studying equity in completion-prediction models have
      documented these calibration gaps and traced them to training data
      that encodes historical patterns of discrimination — so the model
      learns the past's inequities and projects them forward as predictions.#cn()
      As Baker and Hawn put it, algorithmic bias in education "poses
      significant threats to educational equity, potentially amplifying
      existing social and economic disparities" — and the harm compounds when
      an instructor with deficit assumptions reads an "at-risk" flag as
      confirmation rather than a cue to help, letting the prediction become a
      self-fulfilling label.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The bias is not in the math; it is in the definition of "at-risk."
      Define it one way and support flows to one population; define it
      another way and it flows to another, so the construct silently sets who
      the system decides to help. The choice of what the model predicts — the
      construct — is a capability-engineering decision with measurable equity
      consequences, and it is the part most often made implicitly, by whoever
      assembles the training labels, rather than governed deliberately by
      anyone accountable for where help is sent.#cn()

      Unlike the discrete failures elsewhere in this chapter, this one is

      announces.#cn() Its lesson, pushed upstream, is the chapter's:
      governing an algorithm's fairness begins not at deployment but at
      construct definition and label choice, with an equity audit of what the
      model is asked to predict and for whom the prediction allocates help —
      catching the bias where it is introduced rather than where it surfaces.
