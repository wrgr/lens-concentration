    // -- Background --
    [
      The two destroyers that collided in the summer of 2017 belonged to
      the U.S. Navy's forward-deployed forces in Japan — the Seventh Fleet
      ships kept at the highest operational tempo in the surface fleet. For
      more than a decade that tempo had been paid for out of training. In
      2003 the Navy disestablished the in-person Surface Warfare Officers
      School division-officer course that had taught new officers
      seamanship, navigation, and the international rules of the road, and
      replaced it with a set of self-study CD-ROMs — known in the fleet as
      "SWOS in a Box" — that officers were expected to complete on their own
      at sea.#cn() The change saved schoolhouse time and money; it also
      removed the structured setting in which the fundamentals had been
      taught, practiced, and tested. Forward-deployed ships compounded the
      problem: unlike vessels based in the United States, which rotate
      through a defined cycle of maintenance, training, and deployment, the
      Japan-based ships were treated as continuously available, and the
      training time that cycle protects was the first thing spent when
      demand rose.

      By 2017 the erosion was measurable. The Government Accountability
      Office reported that, as of June 2017, 37 percent of the warfare
      certifications held by the cruiser and destroyer crews based in
      Japan — including the certifications for basic seamanship — had
      expired, a fivefold increase since 2015.#cn() Ships were operating in
      some of the world's busiest waterways with lapsed qualifications
      because the schedule never left room to renew them, and expired
      certifications had become so routine that they were waived rather than
      corrected.
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      On 17 June 2017 the USS Fitzgerald, steaming off the Izu Peninsula
      south of Tokyo Bay, crossed into the path of the container ship ACX
      Crystal and was struck on the starboard side; seven sailors drowned
      in their flooding berthing compartment. The Fitzgerald was the
      give-way vessel in a crossing situation and had the clearer picture,
      yet its bridge team took no early or substantial action to avoid the
      much larger ship, and an unexplained course change in the final
      minutes turned the destroyer directly into the collision.#cn() The
      container ship, many times the destroyer's displacement, opened the
      hull below the waterline and flooded two berthing compartments where
      the crew was sleeping; only the damage-control efforts of the
      surviving sailors kept the Fitzgerald from sinking.

      Nine weeks later, on 21 August 2017, the USS John S. McCain collided
      with the tanker Alnic MC in the Singapore Strait; ten sailors died and
      dozens more were injured. In the minutes before impact the watch team
      believed it had lost steering. It had not. While shifting control of
      the throttles between consoles, a watchstander had unintentionally
      transferred steering to a different station — steering was available
      the entire time, but no one on the bridge understood the ship-control
      console well enough to recognize what had happened or to take it
      back.#cn() The destroyer swung across the strait and into the path of
      the tanker, which struck it on the port side at the berthing
      compartments, repeating in nine weeks the same lethal geometry.
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The Navy's own Comprehensive Review, completed in November 2017,
      judged both collisions avoidable and traced them to deficiencies in
      the most basic skills of mariners — watchstanding, navigation, and the
      operation of the ships' own equipment.#cn() The National
      Transportation Safety Board, investigating independently, arrived at
      the same place by a different road: its report on the McCain found the
      probable cause to be a lack of effective operational oversight by the
      Navy that produced insufficient training and inadequate bridge
      operating procedures.#cn() The board also faulted the console itself.
      The McCain's integrated bridge used a touch-screen steering and
      throttle system the Navy had adopted across the destroyer fleet, and
      its design made the unintended, unilateral transfer of control not
      merely possible but easy — a human-factors trap waiting for an
      under-trained crew.#cn() The two investigations reinforced each other.
      On the Fitzgerald the NTSB found a bridge team that did not use its
      radars or lookouts effectively and did not communicate as the
      situation developed; on the McCain it found watchstanders who had
      never been drilled on the casualty they now faced. In both cases the
      crews were fatigued, working watch rotations that left little room for
      rest, and in both cases the proximate errors sat on top of the same
      foundation — sailors asked to do, in the dark and at speed, things
      their training had never reliably given them.
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      What makes Fitzgerald and McCain the canonical training-gap case is
      that the gap was invisible from inside the system. The Strategic
      Readiness Review, delivered in December 2017, described risks that had
      accumulated over time and done so insidiously: the dynamic environment
      of the Western Pacific had normalized to the point where individuals
      and groups could no longer recognize that the very processes meant to
      surface readiness shortfalls had themselves stopped working.#cn()
      Stated readiness and actual readiness had diverged for more than a
      decade, and the instruments that should have caught the divergence
      kept reporting that all was well. The divergence was not a secret kept
      from leadership so much as a fact the system had stopped being able to
      see: commanders who asked for more time to train were told the
      mission came first, and the readiness reports continued to register
      green. The cost of the gap was not paid in a failed inspection. It was
      paid in seventeen lives, two ships, and two months.
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The response was the most far-reaching surface-warfare reform in a
      generation. The Navy reconstituted formal, in-person officer
      training, rebuilding and lengthening the junior-officer pipeline it
      had dismantled in 2003; stood up a Ready-for-Sea Assessment and
      tighter oversight of forward-deployed readiness; and adopted circadian
      watchbills to manage the crew fatigue the reviews had documented.#cn()
      Acting on the NTSB's findings, the Navy also moved to replace the
      touch-screen throttle and helm controls with physical throttles and a
      traditional wheel — an admission that the interface, not only the
      people, had been part of the failure. Commanding officers and senior
      watchstanders were relieved and disciplined, and the Navy stood up a
      dedicated command in Japan to oversee the readiness of its
      forward-deployed ships, so that certification and training could no
      longer be quietly traded away for operational tempo. The case opens
      this book because it shows both how far a capability system can erode
      before anyone notices and what it costs to rebuild one after the fact
      rather than before — when the bill arrives not as a budget line but as
      a casualty list.

    When the pitot tubes iced over at cruise altitude over the South
    Atlantic and the autopilot disconnected, the crew had to hand-fly the
    aircraft in conditions for which they had never trained. The pilot
    flying pulled the nose up — the opposite of correct stall recovery — and
    held that input almost continuously until the aircraft hit the ocean
    three and a half minutes later. The stall warning sounded for
    fifty-four seconds. The crew never identified the stall.

    Air France trained pilots in stall recovery at low altitude but not at
    cruise altitude. Simulators of the era could not faithfully reproduce
    aircraft behavior outside the normal flight envelope, so training
    focused on prevention rather than recovery. The BEA concluded:
    "The combination of the warning system ergonomics, the conditions
    under which pilots are trained and exposed to stalls during their
    professional and recurrent training, did not result in reasonably
    reliable expected behaviour patterns."

    The training matched one operational context. It did not match the one
    that killed two hundred and twenty-eight people.

    A relatively minor cooling-system malfunction at Unit 2 — a
    Babcock & Wilcox pressurized-water reactor — escalated to a
    partial meltdown because the operators were under-skilled for the
    failure they actually faced. They had been trained for worst-case
    scenarios; this was an ambiguous cascade, in which the most
    important indicator — a stuck-open pilot-operated relief valve —
    was misread on the control panel. The control-room light
    indicated the *command* signal to close the valve, not its actual
    position; the valve was stuck open while the panel reported
    "closed." Misreading pressurizer level as indicating that the
    system was going solid, the operators throttled high-pressure
    injection precisely when more was needed.

    The post-incident consensus, captured by the Kemeny Commission, was
    that the human element of nuclear plant operations was a far more
    important risk factor than the industry had recognized — a criticism
    that applied not only to the operators but to plant management, the
    utility, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission itself.

    TMI did not produce another reactor accident. It produced INPO (see
    Case 16) — the canonical example in this book of a failure that

    The 2022 National Defense Strategy designates the Indo-Pacific as DoD's

    virtual training substitutes, multinational exercises pressed into
    proxy duty — but the structural gap persists.

    Kegworth is the textbook example of Capability Degradation Under

    excellent — for the airframe they had flown the previous week. The

    model with enough force to keep it from being misapplied. The new
    airframe was treated as an incremental change. The crew's response
    revealed it was a categorical one.

    LENS treats Kegworth in LEN 5 as the canonical *system-change*
    capability problem and in LEN 8 as the institutional version: how
    knowledge about what has changed travels from engineering to
    operations and what gets lost in transit. The case sits alongside
    Patriot (Case 19) in the canonical problem-type pair for system
    transition.

  body: [
    Friendly fire in Desert Storm produced an unprecedented share of
    coalition casualties: thirty-five of one hundred forty-eight U.S.
    combat dead, and nine of the British dead — eight of the British
    KIA from a single A-10 attack on Warrior infantry-fighting
    vehicles. The rate was an order of magnitude above the historical
    two-percent baseline documented by Shrader in 1982. In another
    incident, A-10 fire on LAV-25 light-armored vehicles near Khafji
    killed seven Marines after a forward controller cleared the
    strike without realizing the vehicles were friendly. In
    Afghanistan, a B-52 JDAM strike on a position near Qala-i-Jangi
    killed three U.S. Special Forces after a controller's GPS reset
    its coordinates following a battery change; in 2014 a B-1
    targeting pod could not detect the infrared strobes worn by U.S.
    SOF on the ground, and the resulting strike killed five.

    The Army identified leading causes as "chaos and confusion of warfare;
    inadequate situational awareness; inadequate employment of, and
    adherence to, fire control measures; and combat-identification
    failures." A 1993 external study found that the lack of a
    comprehensive and accessible automated database prevented thorough
    examination of the problem — meaning the capability to learn from
    fratricide was itself a capability gap. Two decades later, the rate
    had not returned to baseline.

    Fratricide is a multi-decade capability problem that resists single-

    awareness, fire-control discipline, combat identification, joint

    the capability, and integration is the hardest property to engineer

  body: [
    Following the 1984 death of Libby Zion at a New York teaching
    hospital — focal point of a multi-decade argument about resident
    physician fatigue — the Accreditation Council for Graduate
    Medical Education (ACGME) imposed an 80-hour weekly cap on
    resident work hours in 2003. In 2011 the rules tightened
    further: first-year residents were capped at 16-hour shifts. The
    intent was to address a documented training-gap pattern:
    residents making fatigue-related errors they would not have made
    rested.

    The intervention was a single-variable change to a complex
    capability system. Two large RCTs — FIRST (Bilimoria et al.,
    NEJM 2016) and iCOMPARE (Silber et al., NEJM 2019) — compared
    flexible duty-hour policies with the strict caps. Both found no
    difference in 30-day patient outcomes; both surfaced increased
    hand-offs per admission, themselves a documented site of error.
    Resident continuity-of-care and procedural exposure decreased;
    residents reported feeling less prepared rather than more
    rested. In 2017 ACGME relaxed the 16-hour intern cap.
