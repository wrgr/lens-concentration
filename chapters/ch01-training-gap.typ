  summary: [
    In the summer of 2017 two U.S. Navy destroyers of the forward-deployed
    Seventh Fleet collided with merchant ships nine weeks apart, killing
    seventeen sailors — seven on the _Fitzgerald_, ten on the _John S.
    McCain_. Their crews' seamanship, navigation, and console skills had
    eroded under a decade of relentless operational tempo and the self-study
    "training" that replaced the in-person school the Navy cut in 2003.
    Investigations by the Navy and the NTSB judged both collisions avoidable
    and traced them to insufficient training and weak oversight; on the
    McCain, a confusing touch-screen helm let a watch team believe it had
    lost steering it never actually lost. The case is this book's canonical
    training gap: stated readiness and real readiness diverged for years, and
    the system could no longer see the difference.

    // -- Background --
    [
      The destroyers belonged to the forward-deployed Seventh Fleet in Japan,
      kept at the fleet's highest tempo — where training was the first thing
      spent. In 2003 the Navy replaced its in-person Surface Warfare Officers
      School course with self-study CD-ROMs, "SWOS in a Box."#cn() By 2017
      the GAO found 37 percent of the Japan-based ships' warfare
      certifications — including basic seamanship — expired, a fivefold rise
      since 2015, with lapses routinely waived rather than fixed.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      On 17 June 2017 the Fitzgerald, the give-way vessel, took no early
      action and was struck by the container ship ACX Crystal off Japan;
      seven sailors drowned in a flooding berthing compartment.#cn() Nine
      weeks later the John S. McCain collided with the tanker Alnic MC near
      Singapore, killing ten: while shifting throttle control between
      consoles, a watchstander unknowingly handed off steering, and no one
      understood the touch-screen helm well enough to see it.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The Navy's Comprehensive Review (2017) judged both collisions avoidable,
      citing failures in basic seamanship, navigation, and operating the
      ships' own equipment.#cn() The NTSB found the McCain's probable cause
      to be a lack of Navy oversight producing insufficient training and
      inadequate bridge procedures,#cn() and faulted the touch-screen helm,
      whose design made an unintended transfer of steering easy — a trap
      waiting for an under-trained crew.#cn()

    // -- The Capability Gap --

      The gap was invisible from inside. The Strategic Readiness Review
      (2017) described risks that "accumulated over time and did so
      insidiously," the system no longer able to see that the processes
      meant to surface shortfalls had themselves failed.#cn() Stated and
      actual readiness had diverged for a decade while the reports stayed
      green; the cost came as seventeen lives, not a failed inspection.
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The reforms were the deepest in a generation: the in-person officer
      pipeline rebuilt, a Ready-for-Sea Assessment and a forward-readiness
      command stood up, circadian watchbills adopted, and the touch-screen
      helm slated for replacement by a conventional wheel.#cn() Each conceded
      that the training and the interface had been real requirements all
      along — and that trading them for tempo only moved the cost onto two
      ships full of people.

  summary: [
    Air France Flight 447, an Airbus A330, fell into the South Atlantic on
    1 June 2009, killing all 228 aboard — the deadliest accident in the
    airline's history. At cruise altitude the pitot probes iced over, the
    airspeed readings failed, and the autopilot handed the jet to a crew
    that had never trained to fly it by hand in that regime. The pilot
    flying held the nose up into a full aerodynamic stall and never
    recognized it; the aircraft descended for nearly four and a half
    minutes. The BEA traced the loss to the airspeed failure, the crew's
    inappropriate inputs, and a training system that taught stall
    prevention at low altitude but never stall recovery at altitude — a gap
    between the trained envelope and the operational one that reshaped
    global pilot-training rules.

  sections: (
    // -- Background --
    [
      AF447 left Rio for Paris on 31 May 2009 with 228 aboard an Airbus
      A330 — a highly automated jet with an excellent safety record. Its
      route crossed the equatorial storm band, and it carried a known
      vulnerability: pitot probes prone to brief icing at altitude. A
      replacement program was underway, but the accident aircraft had not
      yet been modified.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      At 35,000 feet the probes iced, the airspeed readings went invalid,
      and the autopilot and autothrust disconnected into a degraded control
      law. The pilot flying responded with sustained nose-up input; the jet
      climbed, stalled, and never recovered, falling some 38,000 feet into
      the ocean in about four and a half minutes. The stall warning sounded,
      then cut out at extreme angle of attack and resumed when the nose
      dropped — warning against the one input that would have begun a
      recovery.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The BEA's 2012 final report named a chain: airspeed loss from pitot
      icing, inappropriate crew inputs, and the crew's failure to recognize
      and recover from the stall.#cn() The pilots were not incompetent — they
      were outside anything their training had prepared them for, and the
      BEA said so: "the conditions under which pilots are trained and
      exposed to stalls… did not result in reasonably reliable expected
      behaviour patterns."#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The gap was precise. Airlines trained stall recovery at low altitude;
      the simulators of the era could not reproduce a high-altitude stall,
      so crews never practiced the situation that arrived. Years of reliable
      automation had also let hand-flying skills atrophy. The trained
      envelope and the operational envelope had quietly diverged, and AF447
      fell into the gap between them.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The BEA's recommendations reached far beyond one airline: the pitot
      probes were replaced, and the report pressed for training in manual
      high-altitude flight, stall recovery, and unreliable-airspeed
      handling.#cn() Regulators then made Upset Prevention and Recovery
      Training mandatory for airline pilots, closing at the regulatory level
      the gap that had been invisible at the airline level. The crew
      performed exactly as trained; the training was the wrong training.#cn()

    slow, ambiguous cascade and cut the cooling the core needed. A nearly
    identical near-miss at Davis-Besse eighteen months earlier had never
    been propagated to the fleet. The Kemeny Commission concluded the
    fundamental problems were people-related, not equipment. Off-site

      Three Mile Island's Unit 2, a Babcock & Wilcox reactor near

      came.#cn() It should not have surprised anyone: eighteen months
      earlier a nearly identical stuck-open relief valve had occurred at

    // -- What Happened --
    [
      On 28 March 1979 a minor secondary-cooling upset tripped the reactor;
      a relief valve opened and then stuck open, draining coolant. The
      control-room light reported the *command* to close it, not its actual
      position, so the panel read "closed" while the valve stayed open.
      Misreading the rising pressurizer level, the operators throttled back
      the high-pressure injection the starving core depended on. About half
      the core melted; off-site radiation, as it turned out, was minimal.#cn()

      The Kemeny Commission (October 1979) inverted the industry's
      assumptions: "the fundamental problems are people-related problems and
      not equipment problems." The equipment was good enough that, but for
      the human failures, the accident would have been minor. The criticism
      reached past the operators to management, the utility, and the NRC —

      impossible.#cn()

      The gap was not intelligence but the right capability for the event
      that arrived. Operators drilled on design-basis ruptures had no model
      for an ambiguous cascade, and a control room reporting commands rather
      than states made correct diagnosis nearly impossible. Beneath that lay
      a second failure: the capacity to *learn* — to turn Davis-Besse into
      fleet knowledge — had itself broken down, which is why the case
      resists any single-cause reading.#cn()

      lacked.#cn() The NRC overhauled licensing, required plant-referenced
      simulators and resident inspectors, and tied training to a national
      standard so that diagnosing ambiguous transients — not just textbook
      ruptures — became something crews practiced. TMI is paired later with
      INPO (Case 16) as the book's strongest argument that failure can
      engineer durable reform.#cn()

    [
      On 8 January 1989 British Midland Flight 92, a nearly new Boeing
      737-400 (G-OBME), left Heathrow for Belfast with 126 aboard. The -400
      was a recent variant — bigger engines, a partly redesigned cockpit
      with new electronic engine instruments. The crew were experienced 737
      pilots, but their conversion onto the variant had been brief and
      largely self-directed, the differences communicated as reading rather
      than drilled retraining.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      Climbing through 28,300 feet, a fan blade fractured in the left engine,
      filling the cabin with vibration and smoke. Reasoning from older 737s —
      on which the air-conditioning bleed drew from the right engine — the
      crew concluded the right engine was the source and throttled it back.
      The symptoms eased (partly because the autothrottle had also cut power
      on the failing left engine), seeming to confirm it, and they shut the
      right engine down. On final approach the damaged left engine failed
      completely; with the good engine off, the aircraft struck the M1
      embankment short of the runway — 47 killed, 74 seriously injured.#cn()

    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The Air Accidents Investigation Branch traced the disaster to the
      shutdown of the serviceable engine, and to a mental model carried from
      earlier 737s and applied to a -400 whose bleed-air configuration
      Boeing had changed — a difference the conversion training never
      disturbed.#cn() The new electronic displays did not help: the vibration
      indicator that would have pointed at the failing engine was harder to
      read at a glance than the dials it replaced.#cn() And though cabin crew
      and passengers could see flames from the left engine, that never
      reached the flight deck — a crew-resource-management gap aviation would
      later train hard against.#cn()

      The crew were skilled, and their mental model was correct — for the
      airplane they had flown the week before. The -400 was treated, for
      training, as an incremental change to a familiar type; under emergency
      pressure it behaved as a categorical one. Reading a manual note about
      revised bleed air is not the same as drilling a new reflex that fires
      before the old one, and the cockpit redesign had quietly removed
      perceptual cues a startled crew relies on. Capability had degraded
      under system change with no one noticing, because nothing failed until
      the day it did.#cn()

      Kegworth became a standard human-factors teaching case and a reference

      not detect the infrared strobes marking U.S. troops, killing five. Each
      contributor was worked on; the integration *across* them — which is

      fatigue causes error, so reduce the hours. It was, in capability terms,
      a single-variable intervention: change one input and expect the outcome
      to move.#cn()

    // -- How It Worked --
    [
      But hours were one input to a system with many. Cutting them
      redistributed the work and multiplied patient hand-offs — themselves a
      documented site of error — while reducing residents' continuity and the
      procedural repetitions that build skill; many reported feeling less
      prepared, not better rested. The long shift had quietly been doing work
      no one accounted for, and nothing was put in its place.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Evidence --
    [
      Two large randomized trials tested the policy. FIRST (Bilimoria et al.,
      _NEJM_ 2016), in surgery, found flexible duty hours non-inferior to the
      strict caps on patient outcomes and no worse for resident
      well-being.#cn() iCOMPARE (Silber et al., _NEJM_ 2019), in internal
      medicine, reached a parallel result.#cn() Neither found the safety gain
      the cap had promised, and in 2017 the ACGME relaxed the 16-hour intern
      limit. The trials did not show fatigue is harmless — only that cutting
      one input, without rebuilding supervision and hand-offs, did not produce
      a safer system.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Transferred --
    [
      Duty-hour reform is the book's clearest case of a single-variable
      intervention into a multi-variable system. Read it against the
      successes here — the Keystone ICU project, crew resource management, the
      surgical safety checklist — which worked because they engineered
      supervision, hand-offs, and measurement *together with* the behavioral
      change.#cn() The lesson is not that fatigue does not matter; it is that
      capability is a property of the whole system, and a reform that moves
      one variable while leaving the others untouched will be judged, in the
      end, by what it actually produced.

    to discuss measurement architecture (what FIRST and iCOMPARE
