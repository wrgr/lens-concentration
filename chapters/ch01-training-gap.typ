  summary: [
    In the summer of 2017 two U.S. Navy destroyers of the forward-deployed
    Seventh Fleet collided with merchant ships nine weeks apart, killing
    seventeen sailors — seven on the _Fitzgerald_, ten on the _John S.
    McCain_. Their crews' seamanship, navigation, and console skills had
    eroded under a decade of relentless operational tempo and the self-study
    "training" that replaced the in-person school the Navy cut in 2003.
    Investigations by the Navy and the NTSB judged both collisions avoidable
    and traced them to insufficient training and weak oversight; on the
    McCain, a confusing touch-screen helm let a watch team believe it had
    lost steering it never actually lost. The case is this book's canonical
    training gap: stated readiness and real readiness diverged for years, and
    the system could no longer see the difference.

    [
      The destroyers belonged to the forward-deployed Seventh Fleet in Japan,
      kept at the fleet's highest tempo — where training was the first thing
      spent. In 2003 the Navy replaced its in-person Surface Warfare Officers
      School course with self-study CD-ROMs, "SWOS in a Box."#cn() By 2017
      the GAO found 37 percent of the Japan-based ships' warfare
      certifications — including basic seamanship — expired, a fivefold rise
      since 2015, with lapses routinely waived rather than fixed.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      On 17 June 2017 the Fitzgerald, the give-way vessel, took no early
      action and was struck by the container ship ACX Crystal off Japan;
      seven sailors drowned in a flooding berthing compartment.#cn() Nine
      weeks later the John S. McCain collided with the tanker Alnic MC near
      Singapore, killing ten: while shifting throttle control between
      consoles, a watchstander unknowingly handed off steering, and no one
      understood the touch-screen helm well enough to see it.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The Navy's Comprehensive Review (2017) judged both collisions avoidable,
      citing failures in basic seamanship, navigation, and operating the
      ships' own equipment.#cn() The NTSB found the McCain's probable cause
      to be a lack of Navy oversight producing insufficient training and
      inadequate bridge procedures,#cn() and faulted the touch-screen helm,
      whose design made an unintended transfer of steering easy — a trap
      waiting for an under-trained crew.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The gap was invisible from inside. The Strategic Readiness Review
      (2017) described risks that "accumulated over time and did so
      insidiously," the system no longer able to see that the processes
      meant to surface shortfalls had themselves failed.#cn() Stated and
      actual readiness had diverged for a decade while the reports stayed
      green; the cost came as seventeen lives, not a failed inspection.
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The reforms were the deepest in a generation: the in-person officer
      pipeline rebuilt, a Ready-for-Sea Assessment and a forward-readiness
      command stood up, circadian watchbills adopted, and the touch-screen
      helm slated for replacement by a conventional wheel.#cn() Each conceded
      that the training and the interface had been real requirements all
      along — and that trading them for tempo only moved the cost onto two
      ships full of people.

    // -- Background --
    [
      Air France Flight 447 left Rio de Janeiro for Paris on the night of
      31 May 2009 with 228 people aboard an Airbus A330 — a highly
      automated, fly-by-wire airliner with one of the best safety records
      in the sky. Its route crossed the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the
      band of towering equatorial thunderstorms that long-haul crews
      routinely pick their way around. What the crew could not see was a
      vulnerability already known to the manufacturer and the airline: the
      aircraft's pitot probes, which measure airspeed, were prone to brief
      blockage by high-altitude ice crystals. A series of unreliable-airspeed
      events on A330s and A340s had already prompted a program to replace
      the probes, and Air France had begun retrofitting its fleet — but the
      accident aircraft had not yet been modified.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      A few hours into the flight, at 35,000 feet, the pitot probes iced
      over. The airspeed readings became invalid and the systems that depend
      on them responded as designed: the autopilot and autothrust
      disconnected and handed the aircraft to the crew, with the
      flight-control law degraded so that the envelope protections the
      pilots normally relied on were no longer there. The pilot flying
      responded with sustained nose-up inputs. The aircraft zoom-climbed,
      bled off speed, and entered an aerodynamic stall from which it never
      recovered, descending some 38,000 feet into the ocean in about four
      and a half minutes. The captain was on a scheduled rest break when the
      trouble began; the two first officers left at the controls could not
      reconcile the contradictory indications, and when the captain hurried
      back into the cockpit moments into the emergency, the attitude, the
      alarms, and the readouts gave him no quick way to see that his
      airplane was stalling. For much of the descent neither pilot seems to
      have registered that the other was holding the sidestick nearly full
      aft. The stall warning sounded for roughly fifty seconds; then, at the
      extreme angles of attack the aircraft reached, the airspeed data fell
      below the threshold the warning logic trusted and the alarm went
      silent — only to sound again each time the nose was lowered, which was
      the one input that would have begun a recovery. The system, in effect,
      warned against the correct action.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses (BEA), France's accident
      investigator, published its final report in July 2012. The probable
      cause was a chain: the temporary loss of valid airspeed from pitot
      icing, the crew's inappropriate control inputs that destabilized the
      flight path, and — decisively — the crew's failure to recognize that
      the aircraft had stalled and to apply the standard recovery.#cn() The
      pilots were not incompetent; they were operating outside anything
      their training had prepared them for, and the cues that should have
      told them they were stalling never registered. The BEA stated the
      training failure in institutional terms: "the combination of the
      warning system ergonomics, the conditions under which pilots are
      trained and exposed to stalls during their professional and recurrent
      training, did not result in reasonably reliable expected behaviour
      patterns."#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The gap was specific and, in hindsight, glaring. Airlines trained
      stall recognition and recovery at low altitude, in the takeoff and
      landing regime where stalls were thought to be the real risk. The
      flight simulators of the era could not faithfully reproduce how an
      airliner behaves in a fully developed stall at cruise altitude, so
      that scenario was simply never practiced. Crews were trained to
      *prevent* stalls and to manage an automated aircraft; they were not
      trained to *recover* a large jet hand-flown into a stall at 35,000
      feet, because the industry's training environment could not produce
      the situation. The trained capability envelope and the operational
      capability envelope had quietly diverged, and AF447 fell precisely
      into the gap between them.#cn() There was a deeper version of the same
      gap. Years of reliable automation had let routine hand-flying skills
      atrophy across the profession; pilots spent their careers managing
      systems rather than flying raw, and the rare moment when the
      automation handed control back — at night, in weather, with
      instruments in disagreement — was the moment they were least equipped
      to meet. The capability the airline assumed its pilots held was a
      capability the operation itself had slowly eroded.
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The BEA's final report carried dozens of safety recommendations whose
      reach went far beyond one airline. The vulnerable pitot probes were
      replaced across the fleet. The recommendations pressed for training in
      manual flying at high altitude, in approach-to-stall and full-stall
      recovery, and in handling unreliable airspeed, and for better
      angle-of-attack information in the cockpit.#cn() Most consequentially,
      the accident reshaped the global training standard: regulators moved
      to require Upset Prevention and Recovery Training — explicit
      instruction in manual handling and in recovering an aircraft from
      unusual attitudes and stalls — for airline pilots, closing at the
      regulatory level the gap that had been invisible at the airline
      level.#cn() AF447 is in this book because the crew performed exactly
      as trained. The training was the wrong training.

    // -- Background --
    [
      Unit 2 at Three Mile Island, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was a
      Babcock & Wilcox pressurized-water reactor run by operators whose
      training emphasized large, fast, design-basis accidents — the
      worst-case ruptures the industry believed it most needed to guard
      against. The slow, ambiguous, small-break sequence that actually
      unfolded was not the scenario they had drilled.#cn() It should not
      have been a surprise. Eighteen months earlier, in September 1977, a
      nearly identical stuck-open relief valve had occurred at the
      Davis-Besse plant, another B&W reactor; operators there caught it, but
      neither the utility, the vendor, nor the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
      grasped the event's significance or pushed its lesson out to the
      fleet. The warning that might have prepared TMI's crew never reached
      them.#cn() Many of the operators had come up through the Navy's
      nuclear program and were capable, disciplined people; what they had
      been given was a body of training and a set of procedures built around
      the accidents the industry expected, not the one that the plant would
      actually hand them at four in the morning.
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      Early on 28 March 1979 a minor disturbance in the secondary cooling
      system tripped the reactor. A pilot-operated relief valve opened to
      bleed off pressure, as designed — and then stuck open, quietly
      draining coolant from the core. The control room gave the operators no
      honest picture of this: the indicator light reported the *command* to
      close the valve, not its actual position, so the panel said "closed"
      while the valve stayed open. Reading the rising pressurizer level as a
      sign the system was about to go "solid" with water, the operators
      throttled back the high-pressure injection that was the one thing
      feeding the starving core — cutting the coolant precisely when more was
      needed. About half the core melted. The crisis then deepened for days
      before it was understood: a hydrogen bubble in the reactor vessel
      raised fears of an explosion, conflicting information reached officials
      and the public, and the governor advised pregnant women and
      pre-school children within five miles to leave. The reactor was
      eventually brought to cold shutdown and Unit 2 was destroyed; off-site
      radiation release, as it turned out, was minimal.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island — the
      Kemeny Commission — reported in October 1979. Its central finding
      inverted the industry's assumptions: "the fundamental problems are
      people-related problems and not equipment problems." The equipment, it
      judged, was good enough that, but for the human failures, the accident
      would have been a minor incident. The criticism reached past the
      operators to plant management, the utility, and the NRC itself — an
      institution-wide mindset that treated serious accidents as
      effectively impossible.#cn() The commission was specific about where
      capability had failed: operator training was too narrow and too
      oriented to theory rather than to the diagnosis of real,
      messy transients; the control room was a wall of nearly identical
      gauges and annunciators that buried the few signals that mattered; and
      procedures gave little help in an event that did not match the script.
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The gap was not a deficit of intelligence or diligence but of the
      right capability for the situation that arrived. Operators trained to
      recognize design-basis ruptures had no rehearsed model for an
      ambiguous cascade, and a control room whose indicators reported
      commands rather than states made the correct diagnosis nearly
      impossible to assemble in real time. Layered beneath that was a
      second-order failure: the capability to *learn* — to turn the
      Davis-Besse near-miss into fleet-wide knowledge — had itself broken
      down. The accident sat at the intersection of training, interface, and
      institutional memory, which is why it resists any single-cause
      reading.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      TMI did not produce another reactor accident. It produced a system of
      capability reform. Within nine months the industry created the
      Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (December 1979) to set operating
      standards, evaluate plants against them, and — directly addressing the
      Davis-Besse failure — force the systematic sharing of operating
      experience among utilities.#cn() The NRC overhauled operator licensing
      and required plant-referenced simulators and human-factors review of
      control rooms; it stationed resident inspectors at every plant,
      rebuilt off-site emergency planning, and tied operator training to a
      national accreditation standard so that the diagnosis of ambiguous
      transients — not just textbook ruptures — became something crews
      actually practiced. TMI is paired later in this book with INPO
      (Case 16) as
      its strongest argument: the same incident that exposed how training,
      interface, and institutional memory can fail together also generated
      the most durable example of engineered reform in the book.#cn()

      This case has no single date because the failure is a persistent
      condition rather than an event. For nearly a decade the U.S. Marine
      Corps has been unable to meet its training requirements at ranges in
      the Indo-Pacific Command area of responsibility. The Corps has not
      simply absorbed the shortfall; it has papered over it with
      workarounds — rotating units back to the continental United States to
      use ranges that exist there, substituting virtual and simulated
      training for live events, and pressing multinational exercises into
      proxy duty for capabilities that have no home range in theater. The
      workarounds keep units busy and partially trained; the structural gap
      they are compensating for does not close.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      In May 2024 the Government Accountability Office examined military
      readiness across the services and documented the Marine Corps strand
      in detail: the requirements unmet, the decade over which they had gone
      unmet, and the workarounds standing in for the real thing. GAO
      recommended that the Marine Corps complete a formal analysis of its
      unmet training requirements and develop a plan to identify and
      remediate them at Indo-Pacific ranges; the Department concurred.#cn()
      The report was not the first warning. GAO has pressed the same family
      of readiness recommendations across successive reviews and in
      testimony to Congress, and the limits of overseas training — and their
      absence from readiness reporting — were flagged in its work two
      decades earlier.#cn() What the workarounds cannot reproduce is the very
      thing the ranges exist to provide: the chance to rehearse, at scale and
      against a realistic threat, the specific operations the theater would
      demand. Rotating a unit back to the continental United States trains it
      on American terrain and range geometry, not the distances, basing, and
      electromagnetic environment of the Western Pacific. Virtual and
      constructive simulation fills part of the gap but cannot fully stand in
      for live, instrumented, force-on-force events. Multinational exercises
      build relationships and interoperability but are scheduled around
      partners' priorities, not around the Marine Corps' unmet requirements.
      GAO's recommendation was therefore not simply to train more but to
      first establish what, precisely, the unmet requirements are — to
      convert a decade of acknowledged shortfall into a documented,
      prioritized list against which progress could be measured and funded.
      Until that analysis exists, the Corps cannot say with rigor how large
      the gap is, which makes it easy for the gap to persist, unmeasured,
      behind the reassuring activity of the workarounds.
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      What makes INDOPACOM diagnostically useful is the inverse correlation
      between stated priority and engineered priority. A theater can be
      named the pacing challenge in every strategy document and briefing
      while the training infrastructure to operate in it remains
      structurally short for ten years — and that is not a contradiction the
      system experiences as urgent, because capability follows where
      resources and construction actually flow, not where strategy points.
      Declared priority is cheap; engineered priority — ranges, instrumented
      airspace, basing, the pipeline of certified units — is expensive and
      slow, and the gap between the two is the real measure of intent. For
      a decade that measure has pointed the same way. Building a theater's
      training capability is not a briefing-slide commitment but a
      construction program — ranges with the space and instrumentation to
      rehearse modern fires and maneuver, airspace and sea space cleared for
      it, host-nation agreements, basing, and a steady pipeline of units that
      have actually trained there and been certified. None of that
      materializes from a document's wording; all of it competes for the same
      dollars and political capital as the deployments that consume the force
      day to day. The Marine Corps' workarounds are evidence of professionals
      doing their best inside that constraint — and evidence that best effort
      inside a structural gap is not the same as closing it.
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The reform, such as it is, remains mostly prospective. The GAO
      recommendations were open as of the 2024 report: an analysis of unmet
      requirements to be completed and a remediation plan to be built and
      funded.#cn() Whether the gap closes will be decided not by another
      strategy document but by whether the Marine Corps and the Department
      convert the recommendation into programmed ranges, dollars, and
      schedule. The case sits at the front of this book as the live, ongoing
      counterpart to its historical failures: a capability shortfall that is
      fully recognized, repeatedly documented, and still — at the time of
      writing — not engineered away.

      The F-35 is the most expensive weapons program in history. The
      Department of Defense plans to buy nearly 2,500 of the jets, and the
      program's estimated lifecycle cost now exceeds \$1.7 trillion — of
      which roughly \$1.3 trillion is not the aircraft at all but the decades
      of operating and sustaining them.#cn() That ratio is the whole story
      in miniature: the flyaway jet is the visible, finite part; keeping a
      global fleet of them mission-ready — the maintainers, the technical
      data, the repair depots — is the open-ended part, and it is the part
      that has lagged from the beginning.
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      Like the INDOPACOM case, this failure is a standing condition rather
      than an event. As of March 2023 the F-35 fleet's mission-capable rate
      stood at about 55 percent — the share of aircraft able to perform at
      least one tasked mission — far short of the program's goals. Behind
      that number sat a maintenance system that could not keep up: more than
      10,000 components were waiting in the repair queue, above desired
      levels, and the service depots were taking, on average, about
      72 days to turn a component around. The depots were themselves behind
      schedule in standing up the capacity to do the repairs at all, which
      left the fleet leaning on a pipeline that could not meet demand.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      GAO's September 2023 review carried an unusually blunt title: the
      Department and the services *need to reassess the future sustainment
      strategy*. The report traced the readiness shortfall to a cluster of
      human-capability and information problems — shortages of trained
      maintainers, the military's lack of access to the technical data
      needed to do its own repairs, and the resulting dependence on the
      prime contractor for work the services cannot perform
      themselves.#cn() None of this was a surprise. GAO has reported on
      F-35 sustainment year after year, and successive reviews have repeated
      the same diagnosis even as procurement continued and the readiness
      numbers stayed flat.#cn() The information problem had a name. For
      years the fleet's maintenance ran through the Autonomic Logistics
      Information System, a centralized software backbone so cumbersome and
      error-prone that maintainers improvised workarounds simply to keep
      aircraft moving; the program eventually committed to replacing it, but
      the replacement has come slowly, and a maintenance enterprise can only
      be as good as the system that schedules its parts, tracks its
      components, and authorizes its work. Layered on top were the maintainer
      shortfalls — too few trained people for a fleet still growing — and
      depots that could not absorb the repair demand. The reports return to
      the same structural point year after year: the sustainment model was
      built around assumptions about cost, contractor support, and data
      access that have not held, and adjusting it at the margins has not
      changed the trajectory.
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The F-35 is the cleanest modern example of a platform fielded faster
      than the capability infrastructure to sustain it. Aircraft were
      delivered on a production schedule; the maintainers to keep them
      flying, the technical data to repair them, and the depots to overhaul
      them were treated as follow-on costs to be sorted out later rather
      than as deliverables that had to arrive with the jets. The result is a
      fleet that exists physically but cannot be kept ready, because the
      human and informational half of the system was never engineered to
      match the hardware half — and that half does not catch up on its own.
      The hardest part of the gap is less the headcount of maintainers than
      the access to information. Much of the technical data needed to
      diagnose and repair the aircraft has stayed controlled by the prime
      contractor rather than delivered to the government, so the services
      cannot freely write their own procedures, stand up and qualify their
      own depots, or compete the work — a dependency that is merely expensive
      in peacetime and genuinely dangerous in a conflict that would strain
      the contractor's own supply chain. Fielding the jets without first
      securing that data was a choice whose cost arrives every day an
      aircraft sits grounded for want of a repair the military is not
      permitted to perform itself.
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      GAO recommended that the Department reassess its entire sustainment
      strategy — how it secures government access to technical data, builds
      depot capacity, and grows the maintainer workforce — rather than keep
      patching a model that was not delivering.#cn() Those recommendations
      remain a work in progress: the program's later reviews show costs
      continuing to climb while mission-capable rates stay below goal.#cn()
      The F-35 sits in this book as the live argument for treating
      capability infrastructure — people, data, and the means to sustain
      them — as a fielding gate rather than an afterthought. The bill for
      skipping that gate does not disappear; it compounds.

      On 8 January 1989 British Midland Flight 92, a nearly new Boeing
      737-400 registered G-OBME, left London Heathrow for Belfast with 126
      people aboard. The 737-400 was a recent variant — a stretched fuselage,
      uprated CFM56 engines, and a partly redesigned cockpit with new
      electronic engine instruments in place of the older round dials. The
      crew were experienced 737 pilots, but their conversion onto the new
      variant had been brief and largely self-directed; the differences from
      the airplane they had been flying were communicated as a matter of
      reading, not of practiced retraining.#cn() The variant had entered
      service only months earlier, and British Midland was among its first
      operators; the type's introduction had outpaced the depth of crew
      familiarity that comes from years on an airframe. Pilots converting
      from the older 737-200 received a conversion course measured in days,
      much of it covering the new electronic instrument displays as
      information to be absorbed rather than as a perceptual change to be
      drilled. By every formal measure the crew were qualified on the
      aircraft they were flying that night. What they did not yet have was
      the kind of familiarity that turns the right response into a reflex
      when an engine tears itself apart at altitude and the cabin fills with
      smoke.

    // -- What Happened --
    [
      Climbing through about 28,300 feet, a fan blade fractured in the left
      engine, producing heavy vibration, a burning smell, and smoke in the
      cabin. The crew had seconds to decide which engine was failing.
      Reasoning from the older 737s they knew — on which the air-conditioning
      bleed drew from the right engine — they concluded the right engine was
      the source of the smoke and throttled it back. The symptoms eased,
      which seemed to confirm the diagnosis, and they shut the right engine
      down. It was the one still working. Believing they had isolated the
      trouble, they did not restart it; the vibration had eased when they
      throttled the right engine back — partly because the still-active
      autothrottle had reduced power on the failing left engine at the same
      moment — and that easing read to them as confirmation. They began a
      diversion to East Midlands Airport, and for some minutes the crippled
      left engine ran well enough to sustain the descent while the crew
      worked checklists, radios, and a frightened cabin, the window to
      reconsider slipping past. On final approach, when they called for more
      thrust, the damaged left engine failed completely — and with the good
      engine already shut down, the aircraft had no power at all. It struck
      the embankment of the M1 motorway short of the runway, breaking apart
      just short of safety. Forty-seven people were killed and seventy-four
      seriously injured.#cn()

      The Air Accidents Investigation Branch traced the disaster to the
      shutdown of the serviceable engine, and to why two competent pilots
      made that choice. The decisive factor was a mental model carried from
      earlier 737 variants and applied to a -400 on which Boeing had changed
      the bleed-air configuration; the difference training had never
      disturbed the old model.#cn() The new electronic engine displays did
      not help: the secondary instruments, including the vibration
      indicator that would have pointed straight at the failing engine, were
      harder to read at a glance than the dials they replaced.#cn() And
      although cabin crew and passengers could see flames from the left
      engine, that observation never reached the flight deck — a
      crew-resource-management gap of exactly the kind aviation would later
      train hard against.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      The Kegworth crew were skilled, and their mental model was correct —
      for the airplane they had flown the week before. The -400 had been
      treated, for training purposes, as an incremental change to a familiar
      type; under the time pressure of an in-flight emergency it behaved as a
      categorical one. The training system had not engineered the difference
      with enough force to overwrite a deeply practiced prior model, and the
      cockpit redesign had quietly removed some of the perceptual cues that
      a startled crew relies on. Capability had degraded under system change
      without anyone noticing, because nothing had failed until the day it
      did.#cn() It is worth being precise about what "training" would have
      had to do. Reading a manual that notes the -400's revised bleed-air
      arrangement is not the same as building, through practice under
      realistic pressure, a new reflex that fires before the old one. The
      crew did not reach for the wrong control out of carelessness; they
      reached for the model their thousands of prior hours had built, and
      the conversion course had given them nothing strong enough to override
      it in the seconds that mattered. The gap was not in the pilots'
      diligence but in the design of the transition itself.

      The AAIB issued thirty-one safety recommendations, reaching across

      teaching case in human factors and a reference point for how a

      an old system and a new one are made hard to overlook rather than easy,

      friendly fire; of 467 wounded, 72 (about 15 percent) were hit by their
      own side.#cn() The toll was not abstract. An A-10 strike on U.S.
      LAV-25 light-armored vehicles near Khafji killed seven Marines after a
      coordinated engagement went wrong, and a single A-10 attack on British
      Warrior fighting vehicles killed nine soldiers. Whatever the right
      historical baseline, a quarter of American combat deaths coming from
      one's own forces was a number no one could explain away as the
      ordinary friction of battle.#cn() The incidents shared a grim
      signature: the weapons worked exactly as designed, and the people
      firing them were competent and trying to do the right thing. What
      failed was the chain that lets a shooter know, in the seconds
      available, whether the vehicle or the position in the sights is friend
      or foe — a forward controller's read of a fluid ground picture, the
      coordination between aircraft and the units below them, the markings
      and signals meant to say "us." In the desert, at night, in fast-moving
      armored battle, that chain broke repeatedly, and it broke not because
      any one part was obviously deficient but because the parts did not
      hold together under the speed and confusion of combat.
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The post-war reviews converged on a familiar set of causes: the chaos
      and confusion of combat, inadequate situational awareness, weak
      adherence to fire-control measures, and combat-identification
      failures — crews and controllers unable to tell friend from foe fast
      enough under fire.#cn() One finding cut deeper than the rest. Analysts
      noted that the military lacked a comprehensive, accessible record of
      fratricide incidents, which meant the institution could not study its
      own pattern rigorously. The capability to *learn* from friendly fire
      was itself missing — a second-order gap sitting beneath the
      first.#cn() That second-order gap mattered as much as any single
      engagement. Without a rigorous, shared record, the services could not
      separate the incidents that arose from training from those that arose
      from doctrine, equipment, or the irreducible chaos of battle; they
      could not tell whether a given fix was working or whether an apparent
      improvement was simply a quieter war. Each service investigated its own
      tragedies, often thoroughly, but the lessons stayed local, and the
      pattern across them — the part that would have told the institution
      where to invest — went largely unassembled. A problem that is not
      measured well is a problem that is easy to declare solved and easy to
      keep having.
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      Fratricide is not one problem but the failure of several systems to
      integrate: situational awareness, fire-control discipline, combat
      identification, and joint coordination each became the subject of
      dedicated programs, yet the rate did not fall to anything like a
      negligible level in the conflicts that followed. In Afghanistan a
      satellite-guided bomb strike went fatally wrong after a controller's
      device reset its coordinates following a battery change, and in 2014 a
      B-1's targeting pod could not detect the infrared strobes U.S. troops
      were wearing to mark themselves, and the strike killed five. Each
      contributor had been worked on; the integration *across* them — the
      property that actually keeps friendly forces from killing each
      other — is the hardest thing to engineer by program, and it is where
      the capability kept failing.#cn() This is why fratricide resists the
      single fix that intuition reaches for. A better radio, a new
      transponder, a tracking display — each addresses one contributor, and
      each has been bought; but the instant that decides whether a strike
      kills the enemy or a friend is the instant all of them must come
      together correctly, fast, under stress, across services and sometimes
      across allies. Integration is not a box that any one program office
      owns, and it does not appear on a procurement schedule. It has to be
      trained, exercised, and measured as a capability in its own right —
      which is far harder than fielding any of its parts.
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The response was a generation of combat-identification investment:
      better identification-friend-or-foe systems, position-reporting and
      blue-force-tracking networks, and changes to fire-control doctrine and
      training. The improvements were real, and yet fratricide never dropped
      to a confidently low, stable rate, and even measuring it remained
      contested.#cn() That is the lesson the case carries into this book:
      where capability is an emergent property of many systems working
      together, no single program — and no single technology — closes the
      gap, and progress has to be measured against an honest baseline rather
      than a convenient one.

    // -- Background --
    [
      In 1984 Libby Zion, an 18-year-old patient, died at a New York teaching
      hospital in a case her family blamed on overworked, under-supervised
      residents. The death became the focal point of a decades-long argument
      about resident-physician fatigue: trainees routinely worked punishing
      hours with little sleep and thin supervision, and the worry was that
      exhausted doctors made errors that rested ones would not. New York
      convened the Bell Commission, whose recommendations led the state in
      1989 to limit residents' hours and strengthen on-site supervision —
      the first such rules in the country. For more than a decade those
      limits remained a largely local experiment while the national
      accreditation system weighed whether to follow; accumulating evidence
      on sleep deprivation and a rising public appetite for patient-safety
      reform eventually carried the argument, and the pressure for a
      national standard built from there.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Intervention --
    [
      In 2003 the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
      capped resident work at 80 hours per week, averaged over four weeks. In
      2011 it tightened the rules again, limiting first-year residents to
      shifts of no more than 16 hours. The logic was clean and intuitive:
      fatigue causes error, so reduce the hours and the errors should follow.
      It was, in capability terms, a single-variable intervention — change
      one input and expect the outcome to move.#cn()
    ],
    // -- How It Worked --
    [
      Hours, though, were one input to a system with many. Cutting them did
      not remove the work; it redistributed it, and it multiplied the number
      of patient hand-offs between residents — themselves a well-documented
      site of error, where information falls through the gaps between
      shifts. Continuity of care suffered, and so did residents' exposure to
      the long arc of a case and to procedures they needed repetitions to
      master. In surveys, many residents reported feeling less prepared
      rather than better rested. The cap had changed the input without
      engineering the rest of the system around it.#cn() There was a quieter
      loss as well. The long shift had been doing work no one had fully
      accounted for: it was where a resident watched a patient's course
      unfold from admission through crisis to resolution, where supervision
      happened in the moment rather than across a hand-off note, and where
      the sheer volume of repetitions built procedural skill. Capping the
      hours removed those by-products along with the fatigue, and nothing was
      put in their place — the reform subtracted an input without redesigning
      the system that input had quietly been sustaining.
    ],
    // -- The Evidence --
    [
      Two large randomized trials put the policy to a real test. FIRST
      (Bilimoria et al., _NEJM_ 2016), in surgical-training programs, found
      that flexible, less-restrictive duty-hour policies were non-inferior
      to the strict caps on patient outcomes and no worse for residents'
      well-being and education.#cn() iCOMPARE (Silber et al., _NEJM_ 2019),
      in internal-medicine programs, reached a parallel result: flexible
      first-year policies were associated with non-inferior patient outcomes
      and no significant difference in residents' satisfaction with their
      well-being and education.#cn() Neither trial found the patient-safety
      gain the strict cap had been imposed to deliver. In 2017 the ACGME
      relaxed the 16-hour intern limit.#cn() It is worth being careful about
      what the trials did and did not establish. They did not show that
      fatigue is harmless, nor that hours never matter; they showed that,
      within the range tested, trading the strict cap for flexibility did not
      worsen patient outcomes or resident well-being — which means the strict
      cap's promised benefit failed to appear where it had been most
      confidently predicted. The result reframed the question. The issue was
      never whether tired residents err, but whether reducing one input, by
      itself and without rebuilding supervision, hand-offs, and continuity
      around it, reliably produces a safer system. On the evidence, it did
      not.
    ],
    // -- What Transferred --
    [
      Duty-hour reform is the clearest case in this book of a single-variable
      intervention into a multi-variable capability system — and of the
      evidence eventually catching up with a well-intentioned policy. It is
      worth reading against the successes elsewhere in these pages. The
      Keystone ICU project, crew resource management, and the surgical safety
      checklist worked because they engineered supervision, hand-off, and
      measurement architecture *together with* the behavioral change, rather
      than adjusting one input and assuming capability would follow.#cn() The
      lesson is not that resident fatigue does not matter; it is that
      capability is a property of the whole system, and a reform that moves
      one variable while leaving the others untouched will be measured, in
      the end, by what it actually produced. The field eventually learned
      the constructive version of the lesson. The most durable patient-safety
      advances of the era were not single prohibitions but engineered
      bundles — structured hand-off protocols, checklist-driven processes,
      and supervision redesigned around the points where information was
      being lost — that changed several variables together and measured the
      result. Duty-hour reform earns its place in a training-gap chapter
      precisely because it began as the intuitive move, the one that felt
      obviously right, and because the evidence then did what evidence is
      for: it told the field that feeling right was not the same as being
      effective, and sent it back to design the harder, whole-system answer.
