    The Navy's own review found both collisions "preventable" and "avoidable."
    Fitzgerald's crew did not understand fundamental rules of maritime
    transit or how to use their own radar systems. McCain's watch team was
    not properly trained to operate the ship-control console. A steering
    casualty that should have been resolved in seconds led instead to a
    collision because no one on the bridge knew the correct procedure.

    Root causes traced to years of deferred training and institutional
    knowledge loss. In 2003 the Navy cut the 16-week Surface Warfare Officers
    School course and replaced it with CD-ROM self-study. Operational tempo
    overrode readiness requirements for more than a decade. By 2017 the
    Western Pacific routinely operated ships whose crews were
    under-qualified for the conditions in which they sailed.

    The Strategic Readiness Review put the institutional failure plainly:
    risks accumulated over time and did so insidiously. The dynamic
    environment normalized to the point where individuals and groups could
    no longer recognize that the processes designed to surface the gap had
    themselves stopped working.

    When the pitot tubes iced over at cruise altitude over the South
    Atlantic and the autopilot disconnected, the crew had to hand-fly the
    aircraft in conditions for which they had never trained. The pilot
    flying pulled the nose up — the opposite of correct stall recovery — and
    held that input almost continuously until the aircraft hit the ocean
    three and a half minutes later. The stall warning sounded for
    fifty-four seconds. The crew never identified the stall.

    Air France trained pilots in stall recovery at low altitude but not at
    cruise altitude. Simulators of the era could not faithfully reproduce
    aircraft behavior outside the normal flight envelope, so training
    focused on prevention rather than recovery. The BEA concluded:
    "The combination of the warning system ergonomics, the conditions
    under which pilots are trained and exposed to stalls during their
    professional and recurrent training, did not result in reasonably
    reliable expected behaviour patterns."

  body: [
    A relatively minor cooling-system malfunction at Unit 2 — a
    Babcock & Wilcox pressurized-water reactor — escalated to a
    partial meltdown because the operators were under-skilled for the
    failure they actually faced. They had been trained for worst-case
    scenarios; this was an ambiguous cascade, in which the most
    important indicator — a stuck-open pilot-operated relief valve —
    was misread on the control panel. The control-room light
    indicated the *command* signal to close the valve, not its actual
    position; the valve was stuck open while the panel reported
    "closed." Misreading pressurizer level as indicating that the
    system was going solid, the operators throttled high-pressure
    injection precisely when more was needed.

    The post-incident consensus, captured by the Kemeny Commission, was
    that the human element of nuclear plant operations was a far more
    important risk factor than the industry had recognized — a criticism
    that applied not only to the operators but to plant management, the
    utility, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission itself.

    TMI did not produce another reactor accident. It produced INPO (see
    Case 16) — the canonical example in this book of a failure that

    The 2022 National Defense Strategy designates the Indo-Pacific as DoD's

    Corps has nevertheless been unable to meet training requirements at
    Indo-Pacific training ranges for nearly a decade. GAO-24-107463
    examined military readiness across services and domains; this case
    focuses on the Marine Corps strand, where the agency documented
    workarounds — rotations back to CONUS for ranges that exist there,
    virtual training substitutes, multinational exercises pressed into
    proxy duty — but the structural gap persists.

    The problem is not unrecognized. Senior DoD leaders have testified to it
    in Congress; GAO has published remediation recommendations across
    successive reports; the services have published plans. None has closed
    the gap. The capability infrastructure to operate the U.S. military in
    its declared priority theater does not yet exist at scale.

    What makes INDOPACOM diagnostically useful is the inverse correlation
    between stated priority and actual capability investment. The theater
    is named the most important; the training infrastructure for it is the
    least mature. The pattern is general — capability follows resource

  le-insight: [
    The clearest healthcare case in the dataset of a single-variable
    intervention into a multi-variable capability system. Pairs with
    Case 33 (fratricide) and Case 11 (V-22). The success cases —
    Keystone (14), CRM (12), Korean Air (23) — engineered
    supervisory, hand-off, and measurement architecture *together
    with* the behavioral change.
  ],
  lens-approach: [
    LENS uses duty-hour reform in LEN 5 as the foundational
    capability-system case (what was the long-hour regime
    *producing* that was lost when the input was capped?), in LEN 4
    to discuss measurement architecture (what FIRST and iCOMPARE
    measured, and what they did not), and in LEN 10 as a studio
    prompt for the integrated resident-training redesign that the
    reforms did not deliver.
