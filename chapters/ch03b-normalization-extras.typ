    A startup overfilled a distillation tower because the operators were
    working from instruments that had been malfunctioning for years.
    Vapor accumulated, found an ignition source — an idling pickup
    truck — and exploded. Fifteen contractors in temporary trailers
    parked next to a process unit were killed instantly. The U.S.
    Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) found
    accumulated safety-culture decay, deferred maintenance, broken
    instruments tolerated as routine, and a corporate cost-cutting
    program that had been celebrated internally for the savings it
    produced.

    The CSB's Texas City report became the most influential CSB report
    in the agency's history. It introduced the concept of *process
    safety* — distinct from personal safety — to U.S. industrial
    regulation. Personal-safety metrics at BP Texas City had been
    among the best in the industry. Process-safety metrics, had anyone
    been measuring them, would have shown the opposite.

    The case is the canonical evidence that the wrong measurement is
    worse than no measurement.

    During refueling at the Davis-Besse nuclear plant in Ohio, workers

    The boric acid leakage had been observable for years. Inspections
    had been deferred. The plant operator had successfully lobbied the
    NRC to delay a mandatory inspection that would have caught the
    corrosion months earlier. The NRC's Office of Inspector General
    found that the regulator had accepted the operator's economic
    arguments over its own safety judgment.

    The MSHA investigation found the seals had been built to a design

    methane readings, to disable monitors, to falsify pre-shift
    examinations. Massey CEO Don Blankenship was eventually convicted
    of conspiring to violate mine safety standards — the first U.S.
    mining-industry CEO to be criminally convicted on safety charges.

    The dual-records architecture was not exceptional behavior. It was

    diesel generators were inundated by water that came in higher than

    A tree contact in Ohio sagged a 345 kV transmission line into a

    Eastern Interconnection. Within minutes, fifty-five million people
    were without power.

    The U.S.-Canada Power System Outage Task Force found that
    FirstEnergy operators did not have the situational awareness to
    detect the developing failure, that the company's alarm system had
