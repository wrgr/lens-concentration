    On 23 March 2005 a startup at BP's Texas City refinery overfilled a
    distillation tower — operators were working from instruments that had
    malfunctioned for years — and venting hydrocarbon vapor found an
    ignition source and exploded, killing 15 workers in trailers parked
    beside the unit and injuring 180. The Chemical Safety Board found
    accumulated safety-culture decay, deferred maintenance, and a celebrated
    cost-cutting program. Its central finding reshaped U.S. industrial
    safety: BP's *personal*-safety metrics were among the best in the
    industry, while its *process*-safety state — the integrity of the
    hazardous process itself — had been drifting, unmeasured. Texas City is
    the canonical evidence that the wrong measurement, reported as a win, is
    worse than no measurement at all.

    [
      BP's Texas City refinery, one of the largest in the U.S., had absorbed
      years of deferred maintenance and corporate cost-cutting, with
      instruments and alarms tolerated in a degraded state. On the surface it
      looked safe: its personal-injury rates were among the best in the
      industry.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      On 23 March 2005, during a unit startup, operators overfilled a
      distillation tower far past its safe level, working from a level
      indicator that had malfunctioned for years and alarms that did not
      sound. Hydrocarbon vapor vented, drifted across the site, found an
      ignition source — an idling truck — and exploded. Fifteen workers in
      temporary trailers parked beside the unit were killed and about 180
      injured.#cn()

    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The U.S. Chemical Safety Board's investigation became the most
      influential in the agency's history.#cn() It found accumulated
      safety-culture decay, deferred maintenance, broken instruments
      tolerated as routine, trailers sited dangerously close to a hazardous
      unit, and a cost-cutting program celebrated internally — and it drew
      the distinction that would reshape the field: "indicators of personal
      safety are not indicators of process safety."#cn()

    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      Texas City is the foundational evidence that an organization can
      measure the wrong thing and report excellent performance while its real
      capability gap widens. Personal-safety metrics — slips, trips,
      recordable injuries — carried no information about the integrity of the
      hazardous process, so the signal regime was blind in the very dimension
      that killed people. The wrong measurement, trusted, is worse than
      none.#cn()

    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The Baker Panel review followed, BP invested heavily in process safety,
      and the process-safety/personal-safety distinction — developed in the
      CCPS literature and codified in OSHA's 1992 process-safety-management
      standard — moved into mainstream U.S. industrial regulation after 2005.
      The case's lasting contribution is a measurement lesson: count the
      thing that can kill you, not the thing that is easy to count.#cn()

    at 2,200 psi — a serious near-miss for a loss-of-coolant accident. The

    had won an NRC deferral of a mandatory inspection to fit its refueling
    schedule, and the NRC's Inspector General later found the decision had
    weighted economics over safety. Davis-Besse is the canonical

    // -- Background --
    [
      After Three Mile Island, U.S. commercial nuclear power had built —
      through INPO and a strengthened NRC — a reputation for engineering
      safety as a system. Davis-Besse, a pressurized-water reactor in Ohio,
      operated inside that regime, with a known industry-wide hazard: boric
      acid leaking from cracked nozzles could corrode the carbon-steel
      reactor-vessel head.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      During a refueling outage in early 2002, workers found a cavity about
      the size of a football eaten clean through six inches of the
      carbon-steel head, leaving only a thin layer of stainless-steel
      cladding between the corrosion and reactor coolant at 2,200 psi. Had
      the cladding given way, the result would have been a medium-break
      loss-of-coolant accident with a badly degraded safety margin.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The boric-acid leakage had been observable for years, and inspections
      had been deferred. FirstEnergy had requested — and the NRC had granted
      — a deferral of a mandatory inspection (NRC Bulletin 2001-01) so it
      would align with the plant's February 2002 outage.#cn() The NRC's
      Office of Inspector General later found the agency had inappropriately
      weighted the utility's economic arguments over safety: "the NRC's
      actions were not adequate to ensure that safety would not be
      compromised."#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      Davis-Besse is a near-miss in the dimension above operations: the
      regulator-operator relationship. The same industry that had shown,
      through INPO, that it knew how to engineer safety let a known corrosion
      mechanism go uninspected because inspecting it was inconvenient and
      expensive. Regulatory capture — the regulator adopting the operator's
      economic frame — is a capability failure at the institutional layer
      above the plant.#cn()

    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      INPO and the NRC restructured significant parts of their inspection
      regimes, and reactor-head inspection requirements were tightened across
      the fleet. The lesson pairs with the book's TMI / INPO arc:
      institutional capability is not built once. It erodes if it is not
      re-engineered — and the erosion is quietest where the regulator and the
      regulated agree it is safe to wait.#cn()

    On 11 March 2011 the Tōhoku earthquake and the tsunami it spawned
    overwhelmed TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi plant: the wave topped the

    reactors. Three of the six cores melted down and hydrogen explosions
    spread radioactive material, displacing some 160,000 people; cleanup is
    projected above \$200 billion. The independent Diet commission (NAIIC),
    chaired by Kiyoshi Kurokawa, called it a disaster "made in Japan" — the
    product of regulatory capture and a culture reluctant to challenge
    utility assumptions; evidence of large historical tsunamis had been
    discussed internally but never forced a change to the seawall. Other
    reviews stressed under-estimated external hazards. Fukushima is the
