  impact: "11 killed; largest marine oil spill in U.S. history; $65B+ in damages",
  diagram: dgm.dgm-deepwater,
  body: [
    The National Commission concluded that "human error, rather than
    mechanical failings, was the root cause." The rig crew misinterpreted
    the negative pressure test — the primary safety check for well
    integrity — and proceeded with displacement operations on a well that
    was no longer sealed. The blowout that followed killed eleven men and
    released roughly five million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.

    BP and Transocean training had not adequately covered the
    well-control situations the crew actually faced. The National
    Academies workshop found "a lack of preparation and experience and an
    unclear chain of command prevented key decisions at every step."
    Every one of the rig's many defenses failed — some never engaged,
    some engaged too late, some not as designed: "a complex and
    interlinked series of mechanical failures, human judgments,
    engineering design, operational implementation and team interfaces."

  le-insight: [
    Deepwater Horizon is the canonical multi-layer failure: training,
    procedure, supervision, contractor-coordination, and equipment all
    drifted independently until none caught the others. The negative-
    pressure test was the proximate trigger, but the system as a whole
    had been operating with accumulated procedural debt for years. The
    capability to recognize an unsafe well-state simply was not present
    at the moment it was needed.
  ],
  lens-approach: [
    LENS uses Deepwater Horizon in LEN 5 as the canonical case for
    multi-layer capability analysis. Students reconstruct each defense
    layer, identify the deviation accumulated in each, and design the
    measurement system that would have surfaced the drift before April
    20, 2010. LEN 8 examines contractor-coordination as a capability
    boundary problem.

  impact: "14 astronauts killed (7 per accident); 17 years between identical organizational pathologies",

  body: [
    The Columbia Accident Investigation Board concluded plainly: "The NASA
    organizational culture had as much to do with this accident as the
    foam." Seventeen years after Challenger, CAIB found the same cultural
    patterns intact: a Shuttle Program in which flying with flaws was
    permissible when the flaws were defined as routine, and in which the
    organizational structure suppressed the upward flow of critical
    information.

    Diane Vaughan's concept of "normalization of deviance" — where
    deviations from safety protocols become ingrained through production
    pressures, poor communication, and workplace culture — was developed
    from the Challenger investigation and then validated, against the
    intent of its author, by Columbia. Two crews paid the price for an
    organizational learning failure diagnosed in 1986 and never repaired
    — the strongest single-institution evidence that culture is
    engineerable, and that leaving it unengineered is a choice with
    consequences.

  le-insight: [
    Challenger/Columbia is the strongest documentary evidence that
    organizational culture is an engineerable property of a system, and
    that diagnoses without engineered remediations decay. The same
    pathology, twice, seventeen years apart, in the same institution,
    with the same human cost — and with the diagnosis already on the
    record. Capability engineering treats culture as a deliverable.
  ],
  lens-approach: [
    LENS uses the pair in LEN 1 to introduce normalization of deviance as
    a systems concept, in LEN 8 to examine why organizational learning
    failed across a 17-year interval, and in LEN 7 to address the
    governance failure that allowed a known pathology to persist.

  number: 11,
  title: "V-22 Osprey",
  year: "1991 – present",
  domains-list: ("defense",),
  modes-code: "THN",
  impact: "62 killed across 16 hull-loss incidents (through 2023); mission-capable rates ~50–60%",
  diagram: dgm.dgm-osprey,
  body: [
    A 2025 NAVAIR review and accompanying GAO report found that "materiel
    failure and human-error factors were the most frequently cited causal
    factors in serious Osprey accidents." The 2000 Marana crash that
    killed nineteen Marines occurred during testing in which the program
    had cut corners on trials to keep pace with schedule. Poorly
    understood maintenance procedures and lack of communication across
    the three services operating the platform were identified as
    persistent factors. Mission-capable rates remain at half of design.

    The V-22 is structurally instructive because the platform has
    survived for thirty years in a state of normalized capability
    shortfall. The shortfall has been documented in successive GAO
    reports without producing the readiness regime that the platform
    requires. Each crash carries the same set of contributing factors;
    each is followed by service-level adjustments that do not converge
    across the three services that fly it.

    The capability problem here is not that no one knows it exists. It is
    that the system designed to remediate it has accepted its own
    incompleteness as the cost of operating the airframe at all.

  le-insight: [
    V-22 demonstrates the steady-state version of normalization of
    deviance: a platform whose shortfall has been documented, reviewed,
    and acted on across multiple administrations without producing
    sustained improvement. The capability gap has itself been normalized.
    Each incident is treated as an event rather than as a sample from a
    distribution the program continues to draw from.

  lens-approach: [
    LENS treats V-22 in LEN 5 as a multi-service capability-coordination
    problem and in LEN 8 as a study in long-cycle organizational
    learning failure. Students design the evidence system that would
    distinguish a true reduction in mishap rate from the natural
    variation of a chronically marginal platform.
