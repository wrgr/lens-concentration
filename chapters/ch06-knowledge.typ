  title: "VA Wait-Time Scandal",
  year: "2014",
  domains-list: ("gov",),
  modes-code: "GKN",
  impact: "Veterans died waiting for care; 300,000+ on waiting lists or waiting 6+ months; staff falsified records",
  diagram: dgm.dgm-va,
  body: [
    The VA Office of Inspector General found staff at the Phoenix VA —
    and subsequently nationwide — had created secret waiting lists and
    falsified appointment data to hide that veterans were waiting weeks
    or months for care. The fourteen-day target was unrealistic given
    staffing. The system adapted by hiding reality rather than
    surfacing it.

    GAO had flagged data-reliability concerns since 2000. VA OIG had
    identified problems in 2005, 2007, and 2008. The Obama transition
    team was warned in 2008. None produced systemic change. GAO flagged
    scheduler training as a root cause: schedulers are among the top
    ten highest-turnover positions in the VA, and the institutional
    knowledge required to game the system honestly was perpetually
    lost. Five years after the scandal, GAO still reported data-
    reliability concerns.

    This is Normalization of Deviance applied to *measurement itself.*
    When the measurement system cannot capture reality, the gap between
    reported and actual performance becomes invisible — and lethal.
    Veterans died inside a system that, by its own metrics, was
    succeeding.

  le-insight: [
    The VA case is the canonical example of measurement failure as a
    capability failure. The system that should have surfaced the gap
    instead generated reports that hid it. The turnover among
    schedulers — the human capability operating the measurement
    instrument — meant the institution lost the knowledge to even
    notice it was lying to itself. The case stands as the strongest
    argument in this book for treating decision-grade evidence as a
    design requirement, not a reporting requirement.

  lens-approach: [
    LENS treats the VA case in LEN 4 as the canonical evidence-gap case
    (the measurement system itself was the source of harm), in LEN 7 as
    a governance failure (multiple warnings unactioned over fifteen
    years), and in LEN 8 as a knowledge-loss case via turnover.

  impact: "Active open-source ITS framework with demonstrated learning effectiveness; ubiquitous fielded adoption in routine military training has not been achieved",
  diagram: dgm.dgm-gift,
  body: [
    The Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) is an
    open-source framework for authoring, delivering, and evaluating
    intelligent tutoring systems. Originated under the U.S. Army Research
    Laboratory, it moved after the 2019 Army Futures Command
    reorganization into DEVCOM Soldier Center, where it remains under
    active development with regular releases and an annual peer-reviewed
    GIFTSym symposium.

    Computer-based tutoring has been shown to be "as effective as expert
    human tutors ... in well-defined domains and significantly better than
    traditional classroom training" (VanLehn, 2011), and GIFT sits at the
    center of the effort to lower the authoring barrier. The case is not
    that GIFT was discontinued — it was not. It is that *ubiquitous fielded
    adoption across routine military training remains limited* despite five
    decades of research. That gap is the canonical learning-engineering
    problem: the science is settled, the platform exists, the studies are
    positive — and the institutional pathway to scaled adoption is still
    being built.

  modes-code: "KG",
  impact: "Despite xAPI adoption, most implementations remain siloed; cross-organizational learning-data interoperability largely unrealized",
  diagram: dgm.dgm-xapi,
  body: [
    The Experience API (xAPI) was developed to enable tracking of
    learning experiences across platforms, systems, and contexts — a
    foundational technology for the kind of evidence infrastructure
    LENS envisions. The Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative's
    Total Learning Architecture (TLA) envisioned an ecosystem where
    learning records, competency frameworks, and credential data flow
    across organizational boundaries to support continuous, adaptive
    capability development.

    In practice, xAPI implementations remain largely siloed within
    individual LMS platforms. Cross-organizational data sharing — the
    capability most relevant to high-consequence operational domains —
    has not materialized at scale. The governance infrastructure (who
    owns the data, what consent frameworks apply, how data quality is
    assured) has lagged far behind the technical standard.

    This is an implementation-science failure: the standard exists,
    reference implementations exist, but the institutional and
    governance conditions for scaled adoption do not. The case mirrors
    inBloom (Case 8) in its essential structure — technology in advance
    of governance — except that it spans the entire learning-technology
    ecosystem.

    xAPI/TLA is the technical-standard analog of the implementation

    data flow. This is the canonical case in this book for treating
    data governance as a capability-engineering deliverable.

    LENS treats xAPI/TLA in LEN 4 as a data-governance and
    interoperability case and in LEN 8 as an example of organizational-

  impact: "Average time from research finding to clinical practice: 17 years; only ~14% of research findings ever reach practice",
  diagram: dgm.dgm-17year,
  body: [
    The canonical finding in implementation science: it takes an average
    of seventeen years for research evidence to be integrated into
    clinical practice, and only about fourteen percent of research
    findings ever make it. This is not a single case but a systemic
    condition — the same structural problem the Makary medical-errors
    data (Case 31) describes from the outcome side. Effective
    interventions exist; the system to adopt, sustain, adapt, and
    measure them at scale does not.

    The Active Implementation Frameworks (Fixsen et al., 2005) and the
    EPIS framework (Aarons et al., 2011) — both referenced in LENS
    curriculum design — were developed specifically to address this
    gap. The LENS commitment to threading implementation science
    throughout the curriculum, rather than as a standalone module, is a
    direct response to this evidence.

    The seventeen-year gap is the meta-case for this entire book. Every
    success case in Chapters 8 and 9 represents a closure of this gap
    in one domain. Every failure case represents the gap left open. The
    LENS discipline exists to make seventeen years shorter.

    it deployed. Every case in this book is a sample from a
    distribution governed by that gap. The success cases shorten it;
    the failure cases let it run.

  lens-approach: [
    LENS uses this case in LEN 1 as the foundational problem statement
    of the discipline, in LEN 10 as a studio constraint (designs must
    consider implementation, not just efficacy), and in LEN 8 as the
    central knowledge-transfer challenge. The case is referenced at
    least once in every required course.
