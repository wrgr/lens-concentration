  summary: [
    On approach to Buffalo in February 2009, the captain of Colgan Air 3407
    responded to a stall warning by pulling back on the controls instead of
    lowering the nose; the Bombardier Q400 stalled and crashed into a house
    in Clarence Center, killing all 49 aboard and one person on the ground.
    The NTSB found the captain had a documented history of training failures,
    and the first officer was ill, fatigued, and paid about \$16,000 a year.
    The airline and the hiring pipeline knew the training history; the
    regulator did not. Victims' families mounted one of the most effective
    aviation-safety campaigns in a generation, producing the 2010 law that
    raised first-officer experience requirements to 1,500 hours and created
    the Pilot Records Database. The capability gap was visible to everyone
    except the system that licensed the pilots.

    [
      Colgan Air 3407, a Bombardier Q400 flying a regional route to Buffalo,
      was crewed by a captain with a documented history of training failures
      and a first officer who was ill, fatigued, and paid roughly \$16,000 a
      year. The airline and the hiring pipeline knew the captain's record;
      the regulator did not — the information that should have shaped who sat
      in that seat lived inside the carrier's files and never crossed into
      the licensing system that was supposed to vouch for the crew.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      On 12 February 2009, on approach to Buffalo, the aircraft slowed and
      its stall-warning stick shaker activated. The captain responded by
      pulling back on the control column — the opposite of stall recovery —
      and the Q400 stalled and crashed into a house in Clarence Center,
      killing all 49 aboard and one person on the ground. The reflex he
      reached for was exactly wrong for the situation, the kind of error a
      pattern of failed training events should have predicted long before he
      was handed the controls.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The NTSB found the probable cause to be the captain's inappropriate
      response to the stick shaker, against a backdrop of fatigue, weak
      airline training, and a hiring system blind to the captain's history.
      The data that should have flagged him existed — multiple failed
      training events — but did not flow to the decision that put him in the
      seat, so the hiring choice was made on a record that omitted the very
      facts that mattered most, an absence that looked like a clean slate.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      Colgan is the canonical case for the gap between the information an
      institution holds about its operators and the information that reaches
      the decisions about those operators. The capability that was missing
      was not pilot skill in the abstract but a data flow: a way to make a
      pilot's documented training history actionable at the hiring and
      licensing decision, rather than buried in files no one consulted — a
      record can exist in full and still fail completely if it never reaches
      the moment and the person whose choice it was meant to inform.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The victims' families organized one of the most effective
      aviation-safety lobbying efforts in a generation, producing the Airline
      Safety and FAA Extension Act of 2010 — which raised the minimum
      experience for airline first officers to 1,500 hours and created the
      Pilot Records Database to make pilot history flow between carriers.#cn()
      The 1,500-hour rule remains debated; the records database fundamentally
      restructured how the information that was missing in 2009 now moves,
      converting a buried file into a record a hiring carrier is required to
      retrieve — the difference between a fact that exists and one that
      arrives where the decision is made.

  summary: [
    On a clear afternoon at San Francisco in July 2013, the crew of
    Asiana 214 allowed their Boeing 777 to slow far below approach
    speed without recognizing that the autothrottle was not maintaining
    it. The aircraft struck the seawall short of runway 28L, killing
    three of the 307 aboard and injuring nearly two hundred. The NTSB
    found the crew had mismanaged the approach and inadequately
    monitored airspeed — but also that the complexity of Boeing's
    autoflight systems contributed: after the pilots disconnected the
    autopilot and pulled thrust to idle, the autothrottle reverted to
    a HOLD mode in which it would not wake to hold the selected speed.
    The captain believed it would. Asiana 214 is the most prominent
    recent case of automation surprise on a Western wide-body airliner.
  ],
  sections: (
    // -- Background --
    [
      Asiana 214 was a scheduled Boeing 777 flight from Seoul to San
      Francisco. The captain was experienced on other types but new to
      the 777 and flying it under the supervision of a training captain;
      the approach was a visual one, with the airport's instrument
      glideslope out of service for construction — so a pilot still learning
      the type's automation was hand-flying an approach stripped of the
      vertical guidance that would normally have anchored it, exactly the
      conditions under which an unfamiliar mode is most likely to bite.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      On 6 July 2013, on final approach to runway 28L, the aircraft
      descended below the proper path and slowed. The crew had set an
      autopilot mode that left the autothrottle in HOLD, where it would
      not advance thrust to hold the selected speed. Airspeed decayed to
      about 103 knots against a target of 137; the 777 struck the seawall
      short of the runway, killing three and injuring nearly two hundred
      of the 307 aboard. The thirty-four-knot shortfall built up silently
      while the crew believed the automation was holding the speed, so the
      first unambiguous signal of trouble was the airframe itself running out
      of energy on short final.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The NTSB found the probable cause to be the crew's mismanagement
      of the approach and inadequate monitoring of airspeed, complicated
      by the complexity of the autothrottle and autopilot flight-director
      systems and by the crew's faulty mental model of the automation.
      The captain told investigators he had assumed the autothrottle
      would maintain speed; in that configuration, it does not — a gap
      between the system's documented behavior and the mental model the
      training had left him with, the kind of mismatch that surfaces only
      when the automation is asked to do what the operator wrongly believes
      it is already doing.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      Asiana 214 is the textbook automation surprise on a Western
      wide-body: the mode the autothrottle was actually in and the mode
      the crew believed it was in diverged silently. The missing
      capability was not raw pilot skill but transparency — a system
      that made its own state, and the fact that the crew now owned the
      airspeed, salient at the moment it mattered, rather than leaving the
      handoff of responsibility to be inferred from a silent mode change the
      interface did nothing to announce.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The NTSB issued recommendations on autoflight training, energy-state
      monitoring, and the design of mode annunciation, and emphasized
      training that preserves manual-flying proficiency to counter
      automation dependence. The accident became a standard reference in
      airline automation-policy reviews and in the push toward
      "automation airmanship" curricula — shifting the lesson from one crew's
      error to a recurring design problem about how modes are annunciated and
      how monitoring is taught when the automation is doing most of the
      flying.#cn()

    prematurely; the Bureau insisted the weapon was sound and blamed

    of Admiral Charles Lockwood — who ordered fleet-level live-fire
    tests — to confirm three separate defects: the torpedo ran about
    ten feet too deep, its magnetic exploder fired erratically, and its

      The Mark 14 was the U.S. Navy's standard submarine torpedo at the
      start of the Pacific War. It had been so expensive to test that
      the Bureau of Ordnance had effectively forbidden live trials in
      the 1930s; the weapon went to war essentially unproven against
      realistic conditions, so the very decision meant to conserve a scarce

      in combat, by the crews who could least afford them to surface there.#cn()

      From early 1942, submarine crews reported a litany of failures:
      torpedoes that ran far below their set depth, magnetic exploders
      that detonated prematurely or not at all, and contact firing pins
      that crushed on a direct hit. The Bureau of Ordnance insisted the
      weapon worked and attributed the misses to crew error; captains
      who reported failures risked their careers — an arrangement that turned
      every field report into a self-accusation and so suppressed the very
      evidence that would have isolated the defects the Bureau refused to

      It took eighteen months and the intervention of Admiral Charles
      Lockwood, commander of the Pacific submarine force, who ordered

      July 1943 attack on the Tonan Maru, in which eleven torpedoes struck
      the stopped ship squarely and failed to detonate — forced the issue.
      The tests confirmed the
      torpedo ran about ten feet too deep, that the Mark 6 magnetic
      exploder failed routinely, and that the contact pin buckled on
      perpendicular impact — three independent defects that had been masking
      one another at sea, which is why a fleet commander's controlled trial,
      not another combat patrol, was finally able to separate and prove them.#cn()

      the contact pin — were small. The refusal to believe the operators

      failed diplomacy, the Carter administration authorized a military
      rescue. No standing joint special-operations command existed to
      plan or execute it; the force had to be assembled from units drawn
      separately from the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force — each bringing
      its own equipment, procedures, and chain of command to a mission that

      been selected partly for a minesweeping cover story rather than for
      fitness for a desert rescue. There was no standing organization to
      own the mission end to end — no single authority responsible for the

      trained together. That integration had to be improvised for a
      single high-stakes mission, and the improvisation could not hold —
      because cross-service cohesion is not summoned on demand but accrued
      through standing structure and repeated joint training, neither of

      Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 and the Nunn-Cohen Amendment

      Helios 522 was a Boeing 737 departing Larnaca, Cyprus, for Athens.
      The night before, engineers had run a pressurization leak check and
      left the cabin-pressurization selector in the "manual" position.
      The pre-flight checks did not catch it, and the aircraft departed
      with its pressurization system not set to maintain cabin altitude
      automatically — a maintenance setting left in an abnormal position the
      following morning, the kind of latent configuration error that a
      pre-flight verification exists precisely to catch and here did not.#cn()

      As the aircraft climbed on 14 August 2005, the cabin failed to
      pressurize and a warning horn sounded. On the 737 the same horn
      indicates an incorrect takeoff configuration on the ground and
      excessive cabin altitude in flight. The crew interpreted it as a
      configuration warning and spent minutes troubleshooting the wrong
      problem while hypoxia set in. By the time the aircraft neared Athens
      the flight crew was incapacitated; it circled on autopilot until
      fuel exhaustion and crashed, killing all 121 aboard. The crew spent
      their few useful minutes diagnosing a configuration fault that did not
      exist, the ambiguous horn having steered them away from the one problem
      — climbing cabin altitude — that was quietly disabling them.#cn()

    [
      The Hellenic Air Accident Investigation Board found the crew's
      misidentification of the cabin-altitude warning as a
      takeoff-configuration warning to be a critical, irrecoverable error.
      The single horn carried two meanings with no differentiation between
      them, and the airline's training had emphasized only the ground
      meaning; the in-flight case was an edge condition the crew had not
      been prepared to recognize — so an ambiguous cue and a one-sided
      training regime combined to make the wrong interpretation the natural
      one, with hypoxia closing the window before the error could be caught.#cn()

      Helios 522 is the textbook example of a single cue carrying two
      meanings without differentiation — an interface that lied by
      ambiguity while the training filled in only one of the two meanings.
      The missing capability was a cue, or a training regime, that
      distinguished the deadly in-flight meaning from the routine ground
      one before the operators had to guess under hypoxia — a way to resolve
      the ambiguity at the interface or in training, rather than leaving it
      to be resolved by a crew already losing the cognition the decision
      required.#cn()

      procedure for flying when the instruments themselves cannot be

      Records Database directed by Congress after Colgan Air 3407 was not

      only five years of records — a window too short to surface a pattern

      that the nose was rising into a stall, he pushed forward hard. The
      767 entered a steep dive from which the crew did not recover and
      crashed into Trinity Bay, killing all three aboard. The startle and

      driven by a startle and spatial-disorientation response, and
      identified his pattern of training deficiencies and Atlas's
      inability to access his full record as contributing factors. The
      records that would have informed the hiring decision existed but
      did not reach it — the same information-flow failure named after

      authorized — but it was not yet operational and its coverage was
      incomplete, so the same information-flow gap that killed fifty
      people in 2009 was still partly open in 2019. Partial implementation
      of a remedy leaves a measurable harm inside the aperture — the years

  summary: [
    Forty-three seconds after takeoff from Taipei Songshan in February
    2015, the right engine of a TransAsia ATR 72 auto-feathered following
    a sensor fault. Working from memory under acute time pressure, the
    crew shut down the left engine — the one still producing thrust —
    leaving the aircraft with no power and too little altitude to recover.
    It clipped a viaduct, struck a taxi, and crashed into the Keelung
    River, killing 43 of the 58 aboard. The Aviation Safety Council found
    the captain had failed proficiency checks in the year before the
    accident and that the crew had not used the published engine-shutdown
    checklist, responding instead from a flawed memory of the procedure.
    The wrong-engine error mirrors Kegworth (Case 30) twenty-six years
    earlier.

  sections: (
    // -- Background --
    [
      TransAsia 235 was an ATR 72-600 twin-turboprop departing Taipei
      Songshan. The captain had failed simulator proficiency checks in
      the year before the accident and had been noted for weak handling
      of abnormal procedures. The published response to an engine failure
      was a checklist-driven procedure; under stress, crews tend to revert
      to memory — so a captain already flagged for weak abnormal-procedure
      handling was exactly the operator most likely to skip the checklist
      precisely when it mattered, a known weakness meeting a known failure
      mode.#cn()
    ],
    // -- What Happened --
    [
      On 4 February 2015, forty-three seconds after takeoff, the right
      engine's autofeather system activated following a faulty sensor
      signal — the engine itself was capable of producing power. The crew,
      identifying an engine problem, shut down the left engine, which was
      operating normally. With neither engine now producing useful thrust
      and the aircraft low and slow, it stalled, clipped a viaduct and a
      taxi, and crashed into the Keelung River, killing 43 of the 58
      aboard. A recoverable single-engine event became unrecoverable the
      moment the working engine was shut down, leaving an aircraft with no
      thrust and no altitude in the seconds just after takeoff when both are
      least forgiving.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Investigation --
    [
      The Taiwan Aviation Safety Council found the crew failed to identify
      which engine had actually failed and shut down the wrong one. They
      did not follow the published engine-flameout and shutdown checklist,
      acting from memory under time pressure; the misidentification took
      roughly fifteen seconds. The captain's documented proficiency
      deficiencies and the airline's training and crew-resource-management
      shortfalls were contributing factors — the individual lapse sitting
      atop an organizational one, the carrier having left the very weaknesses
      its own proficiency checks had recorded uncorrected before the flight.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Gap --
    [
      TransAsia 235 is the modern recurrence of the wrong-engine pattern
      that destroyed British Midland 92 at Kegworth in 1989 (Case 30).
      Crews under acute time pressure default to memory; if the memory is
      incomplete, the action follows the flawed memory rather than the
      checklist. The missing capability is a procedure design and training
      regime that keeps the verification step in the loop precisely when
      stress pushes operators to skip it — engineering the confirm-which-engine
      step so it fires under startle, rather than trusting it to a memory
      that time pressure is actively eroding.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Aftermath & Reform --
    [
      The ASC issued recommendations on TransAsia's pilot training,
      proficiency-check standards, and crew-resource management; the
      airline ceased operations in 2016, after a second fatal accident the
      year before. The case is used to argue that the persistence of the
      wrong-engine pattern across a quarter-century reflects an
      un-engineered intervention, not merely individual error — the same
      failure recurring across crews, airframes, and decades points to a
      design and training gap that no amount of blaming the individual pilot
      has ever closed.#cn()

    TransAsia 235 is the modern recurrence of the Kegworth pattern under
    stress. Crews under acute time pressure default to memory; if the
    memory is incomplete or wrong, the action follows the memory. The
    capability gap was the same as in 1989. The intervention pattern
    needed is also the same.

    LENS uses TransAsia 235 in LEN 5 as a recurrence case for
    well-known capability problems (wrong-engine shutdown) and in
    LEN 2 to teach the difference between checklist-driven response
    and memory-driven response under stress.
