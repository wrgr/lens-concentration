  summary: [
    Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Beta are Level-2
    driver-assistance systems: the human driver remains legally and
    operationally responsible at all times. NHTSA's Standing General Order
    data has documented dozens of fatal crashes involving Autopilot since
    the 2016 death of Joshua Brown in Florida, and the pattern is
    consistent — the system performs capably for long stretches, the
    driver's monitoring attention attenuates, and an edge case (a
    stationary object, a faded lane line, a crossing vehicle) produces a
    collision the inattentive driver fails to catch. NHTSA's investigation
    has found Tesla's driver-engagement design inadequate to sustain the
    attention safe operation requires. At consumer scale, Autopilot is the
    live test of whether passive monitoring of good-enough automation is a
    role a human can actually perform.

    // -- The Shift --

      Partial driving automation has moved from research vehicles into
      millions of consumer cars. Level-2 systems like Tesla's Autopilot can
      steer, accelerate, and brake within their operational design domain,
      but they require the human driver to monitor continuously and take
      over instantly — a fundamentally new and demanding role assigned to
      ordinary, untrained consumers.#cn()

    [
      Since the first fatal Autopilot crash — Joshua Brown, Florida, 2016 —
      NHTSA's Standing General Order data has documented dozens of fatal
      crashes involving the system. The pattern is consistent: long periods
      of capable operation, attenuating driver attention, and then an edge
      case — a stationary fire truck, a faded lane marking, a perpendicular
      crossing — that the disengaged driver fails to catch in time.#cn()
    ],
    // -- The Capability Question --
    [
      The proximate cause in each case is the driver, who was legally
      responsible. But the deeper question is whether sustained vigilant
      monitoring of an automation that works well most of the time is a
      role a human can perform at all. Naming the feature "Autopilot" and
      designing weak engagement checks shaped the very inattention the
      system then blamed on the operator.#cn()
    ],
    // -- Early Evidence --
    [
      NHTSA's open investigation (ODI EA22-002) has identified Tesla's
      driver-engagement design as inadequate to maintain the attention safe
      operation requires, and the recurring fatality pattern across NTSB
      reports suggests passive monitoring is not a sustainable role as
      currently engineered. Decades of automation-complacency research
      point the same way.#cn()

    // -- Open Problems --
    [
      Tesla Autopilot is the consumer-scale version of the Uber ATG problem
      (Case 29): a passive-monitoring role deployed without the capability
      infrastructure — training, engagement design, attention measurement —
      to make it performable. The open problem is what driver-engagement
      architecture, if any, could make Level-2 monitoring sustainable for
      an average driver over years of use.#cn()

    In October 2023, a pedestrian in San Francisco was struck by a

    pull-to-the-side maneuver — dragged her about twenty feet. The injury
    was severe, but it was Cruise's institutional response that proved
    company-ending: regulators found Cruise had initially shown
    investigators only the first portion of the incident video, omitting
    the drag. California suspended Cruise's driverless permit, NHTSA opened
    an investigation, and GM ultimately shut down the commercial operation.

    underlying crime — a feedback loop that concentrates policing on
    already-over-policed neighborhoods. Cities including Santa Cruz, New
    Orleans, and Los Angeles have since suspended or abandoned
    predictive-policing deployments after equity reviews. The capability
