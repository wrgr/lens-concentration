  body: [
    Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Beta operate as
    Level-2 driver-assistance systems: the driver remains legally and
    operationally responsible for the vehicle. NHTSA's Standing
    General Order on automated-driving systems has documented dozens
    of fatal crashes involving Tesla Autopilot since the 2016 Joshua
    Brown case in Florida. The pattern is consistent: the system
    operates capably for long periods, the driver's monitoring
    attention attenuates, and an edge-case scenario — a stationary
    object, a faded lane marking, a perpendicular crossing — produces
    a collision the inattentive driver does not catch.

    NHTSA's open investigation has identified Tesla's driver-
    engagement design as inadequate to maintain the attention the
    system's safe operation requires. The proximate cause in each
    case is the driver. The system that created the conditions for
    the inattention is the design choice to call the feature
    "Autopilot."

    Tesla Autopilot is the live, ongoing version of the Uber ATG
    (Case 29) problem at consumer scale: a passive-monitoring role
    designed without the capability infrastructure to make it
    performable.

    feet. The California Department of Motor Vehicles found that
    Cruise had initially shown investigators only the first portion
    of the incident video, omitting the drag.

    The CPUC suspended Cruise's driverless permit. The U.S. National
    Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation.
    GM subsequently shut down Cruise's commercial operations and
    laid off the majority of the workforce.

    The COMPAS risk-assessment algorithm, used in some U.S. jurisdictions
    to inform decisions about bail, sentencing, and parole, was
    examined by ProPublica in a 2016 investigation. The analysis
    found that Black defendants were more likely than white defendants
    to be incorrectly flagged as high-risk (false-positive rate ~44.7%
    vs ~23.5% for white defendants), and white defendants more likely
    to be incorrectly flagged as low-risk. The vendor (Northpointe)
    responded that COMPAS satisfied predictive parity (calibration
    within groups). The academic literature that followed — notably
    Chouldechova (2017) and Kleinberg, Mullainathan & Raghavan (2017) —
    identified the statistical issue as an impossibility result:
    calibration within groups and equalized false-positive/false-negative
    rates cannot all be jointly satisfied when base rates differ across
    groups.

    The case is foundational because it surfaced, at criminal-justice
    scale, the difference between predictive accuracy and the
    distribution of errors across populations. A model can be
    "accurate" by one metric and inequitable by another, and the
    choice of metric is a governance decision rather than a technical
    one.

    Multiple FDA-cleared radiology AI tools — for chest X-ray

    the peer-reviewed literature to perform worse in deployment than
    in their validation studies, often with the degradation
    concentrated in patient populations under-represented in the
    training data. Larrazabal et al. (PNAS 2020) demonstrated this
    structurally for chest X-ray classifiers — substantial drops in
    sensitivity for groups under-represented in training. Adjacent
    work in non-imaging clinical AI (Obermeyer et al., Science 2019,
    on a widely deployed care-management algorithm) showed that bias
    in the *labels* used to train clinical AI can systematically
    under-allocate resources to Black patients even when the
    algorithm appears statistically well-calibrated. Similar patterns
    have been documented in mammography AI, sepsis-prediction tools,
    and skin-lesion classifiers.

    The FDA's 510(k) clearance process for medical AI does not
    routinely require demographic stratification of validation
    metrics, nor does it require post-market monitoring of how the
    tool performs in the populations actually using it. The capability
    gap is at the regulatory architecture, not at the model.

    AI-augmented coding is the live foundational case for human-AI
    teaming in professional knowledge work. The short-term gains are
    real. The long-term capability question — does the tool make the
    operator more capable, or more dependent — is the question the
    discipline must learn to ask and answer.
  ],
  lens-approach: [
    LENS uses AI-augmented coding in LEN 2 as the largest live human-
    AI teaming case in the dataset, in LEN 8 for the long-term
    capability-development question, and in LEN 10 (capstone) as a
    prompt for evaluating AI augmentation in professional practice.

  body: [
    The ninety-nine cases that precede this one have an answer. The
    investigations are complete; the failures are diagnosed; the
    interventions are evaluated. This case does not. It belongs to the
    practitioners now in training — to the students of the LDT
    program and the LENS specialization, to the graduates who will
    take positions in healthcare, defense, education at scale, and
    the human-AI teaming cases that anticipate the next decade — and
    to the institutions those graduates will build.

    The strongest evidence for the discipline LENS represents is the
    cumulative record of what its absence has cost. The strongest
    argument for its possibility is the cumulative record of what
    its presence has produced. Both records are in the preceding
    cases. The work ahead is to add to the second record and shorten
    the first.

    No specific incident sits behind this case because the work is
    not yet done. The discipline is still being built. The institution
    of capability engineering is, in 2026, where INPO was in 1979 or
    where CRM was in 1981 — a discipline whose evidence is
    accumulating, whose practitioners are being trained, and whose
    institutional architecture is not yet complete.

    What the practitioners reading this volume do next is what fills
    in this case.

  le-insight: [
    Every case in this book is closed. This one is open. The
    discipline LENS represents is the discipline that closes cases
    that are now open. The institutions of capability engineering
    that exist in 2026 are insufficient to the volume of capability
    work the contemporary world requires. The graduates of this
    program are the people who will build the institutions that are
    insufficient now.

  lens-approach: [
    LENS is organized to produce the practitioners who can do this
    work. The curriculum's commitments — capability as a system
    parameter, evidence as a deliverable, ethics as design,
    implementation as a thread — are the operational form of the
    argument the ninety-nine preceding cases evidence. Every studio
    project (LEN 10) is a small attempt at this case.
