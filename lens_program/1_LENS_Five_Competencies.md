LENS • Learning Engineering for Next-Generation Systems

# The Five LENS Competencies

Formal names, taglines, main objectives, and subobjectives for case studies, recruiting, and curriculum.

Organizing layer over the formal CLOs. Formal names carry program documentation; taglines carry recruiting and the site. Subobjective numbers (1.1, 3.2, …) are stable tags for case studies, course modules, and capstone rubrics. The CLO language in the program documentation remains the language of record.

## 1. Systems Analysis  •  *see the whole system*

**Formal domain:** Systems Thinking and Analysis (CLO-1)

**Main objective.** Trace how human capability and system performance depend on each other, so interventions target the real problem.

1.1  Decompose system performance requirements into measurable human capability requirements: define what the system demands of its operators and the impact it must deliver.

1.2  Model learning environments and their host operational systems as interacting systems, with defined components, interfaces, and feedback loops.

1.3  Apply systems engineering lifecycle models to scope, sequence, and evaluate capability interventions within and across disparate systems.

1.4  Analyze and communicate human-system interdependencies to identify capability gaps and predict operational impact at scale.

1.5  *[v2]* **Governance-objection diagnostic.** Distinguish a governance objection that good design can dissolve from one that correctly signals the system should not deploy.

## 2. Iterative Development  •  *build, test, refine*

**Formal domain:** Learning Engineering Design and Implementation (CLO-2)

**Main objective.** Design capability interventions through iterative engineering cycles that survive contact with real operational environments.

2.1  Design interventions that integrate learning sciences principles with measurable outcomes and system design constraints.

2.2  Run the iteration cycle: design, instrument, evaluate, refine, and revise the problem framing as evidence accumulates.

2.3  Evaluate evidence-based design strategies for transfer to high-consequence settings at operational speed and scale.

2.4  Construct implementation plans that address adoption, sustainment, and lifecycle integration across organizational and system boundaries.

2.5  *[v2]* **Narrate and defend the design iteration in first person.** Design competence includes not only producing an outcome but rendering the iteration legible — the case-unpacking practice is the model.

## 3. Human-System Collaboration  •  *work together*

*[v2.1 — moved from D5 and broadened from "Machine Teaming and Adaptation." The competency now covers human-system collaboration generally; human-AI teaming is one sub-pattern within it, not a separate domain.]*

**Formal domain:** Human-System Collaboration and Adaptive Systems (CLO-3)

**Main objective.** Design human-system partnerships — including but not limited to human-AI — that make people more capable while preserving human agency and the recoverability of the system.

3.1  Design role architectures, interface and alert systems, mode/state transparency, authority gradients, and recoverability mechanisms that engineer collaborative capability at the human-system boundary.

3.2  Evaluate the measured impact of system-mediated work on human performance: the gains the system enables and the risks it introduces — automation bias, cognitive offloading, skill atrophy.

3.3  *[v2]* **Delegation with revocation.** Design the human oversight layer for delegated work; specify in advance the disconfirming evidence that would revoke the delegation.

3.4  *[v2]* **Collaboration measurement.** Measure the capability of a team or collaboration as a unit of analysis, distinct from any individual operator or any individual system component.

3.5  Specify learning and capability requirements for systems not yet fielded, working from design artifacts rather than operational experience.

## 4. Test and Evaluation  •  *show what works*

*[v2.1 — was D3 in v1; renumbered to D4. Subobjective 4.2 ("gap attribution") was the existing "diagnose the gap"; the v2 sweep names it explicitly.]*

**Formal domain:** Data, Measurement, and Evaluation (CLO-4)

**Main objective.** Produce decision-grade evidence linking learning to operational impact — where decision-grade is a sufficiency judgment under irreducible uncertainty — and tell a learning gap from a system gap.

4.1  Design ethical instrumentation strategies that measure capability at the speed and scale operations require.

4.2  **Gap attribution.** Diagnose the gap: differentiate capability shortfalls rooted in human development from those rooted in system design or organizational performance.

4.3  Construct decision-grade evidence artifacts (dashboards, reproducible reports, governance documentation) under irreducible uncertainty: state what is known, what is assumed, and what would change the decision.

4.4  *[v2]* **Judgment under inadequate evidence.** Justify a consequential decision on incomplete and contested evidence; document the basis; name what would change it.

4.5  Communicate evidence honestly to technical and non-technical stakeholders, including uncertainty and limits of inference.

4.6  *[v2]* **Fairness beyond omission.** Demonstrate that omitting a protected attribute does not establish fairness; analyze competing fairness definitions using demographic-stratified outcome evidence.

## 5. Navigating Sociotechnical Constraints  •  *make it work in the real world*

*[v2.1 — was D4 in v1; renumbered to D5.]*

**Formal domain:** Context and Domain Fluency (CLO-5)

**Main objective.** Integrate capability interventions into the sociotechnical systems they must live in: the regulatory, organizational, cultural, and technical realities that determine whether good designs survive.

5.1  Analyze the regulatory, organizational, cultural, and technical constraints that shape what can be built, deployed, and sustained in a given context.

5.2  Apply human systems integration frameworks to fit capability interventions to operational environments.

5.3  Leverage prior domain expertise, and respect for others', to elicit and validate specialist knowledge that surfaces constraints early.

5.4  Translate constraints and stakeholder requirements across disciplinary and institutional boundaries into coherent design specifications.

5.5  Anticipate adoption and sustainment barriers, and design interventions that survive them.

5.6  *[v2]* **Cross-regime / platform-dependency governance.** Where capability is deployed on a platform governed by a different regime than the one operating it, design the governance seam as an explicit deliverable.

# Crosswalk to Formal CLOs

| # | Competency | Tagline | CLO | Formal domain (program docs) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Systems Analysis | see the whole system | CLO-1 | Systems Thinking and Analysis |
| 2 | Iterative Development | build, test, refine | CLO-2 | Learning Engineering Design and Implementation |
| 3 | Human-System Collaboration | work together | CLO-3 | Human-System Collaboration and Adaptive Systems |
| 4 | Test and Evaluation | show what works | CLO-4 | Data, Measurement, and Evaluation |
| 5 | Navigating Sociotechnical Constraints | make it work in the real world | CLO-5 | Context and Domain Fluency |

Each subobjective unbundles an element of the corresponding CLO. The 7 named v2 additions (1.5, 2.5, 3.3, 3.4, 4.4, 4.6, 5.6) and the explicit renaming of 4.2 (gap attribution) are required elements within the parent CLO. The reframing of "decision-grade evidence" as judgment under irreducible uncertainty is carried at 4.3 and 4.4. If any v2 addition creates friction with documentation of record, drop the number and fold the language back; the scheme renumbers cleanly.

# Using the Tags

Each subobjective number is a stable tag. Three immediate uses:

**Case studies.** Each case in the casebook carries two coordinates: failure mode code(s) from the six-mode taxonomy (T/D/N/H/G/K — what went wrong) and competency tags (what the case teaches). The pairing turns the casebook into a searchable curriculum asset: every course module can pull the cases tagged to its subobjectives.

**Capstone rubrics.** Rubric lines reference tags directly (the gap-attribution rubric line assesses 4.2), giving the attainment profile its evidence trail.

**Recruiting and the site.** Taglines and main objectives are the public-facing layer for capabilitymatters.org and program one-pagers; formal names carry course documentation; the CLO table stays in the documentation of record.

# The five, in one breath

*See the whole system. Build, test, refine. Work together. Show what works. Make it work in the real world.*

# Change Log

**v2.1 — June 2026** *(current)*
- **D3 reorder + rename.** What was D5 (Machine Teaming and Adaptation) is broadened to **Human-System Collaboration** and moved to position 3. T&E becomes D4 (was D3); Sociotechnical Constraints becomes D5 (was D4). The order now reads as the flywheel: see the system → build → integrate humans → measure → deploy.
- **7 new subobjectives** (v2 sweep additions): 1.5 governance-objection diagnostic; 2.5 narrate/defend design iteration; 3.3 delegation with revocation; 3.4 collaboration measurement; 4.4 judgment under inadequate evidence; 4.6 fairness beyond omission; 5.6 cross-regime / platform-dependency governance.
- **1 renamed subobjective:** 4.2 explicitly named "gap attribution" (was the existing "diagnose the gap").
- **Reframed term:** "decision-grade evidence" taught as a sufficiency judgment under irreducible uncertainty, made explicit at 4.3 and 4.4.
- **New tagline:** D3 carries "work together" (parallel to the other four).
- **What the casebook anchor codes mean.** Under v2.1, a `lens-anchor: "D3/PT5"` resolves to **Human-System Collaboration**, problem-type 5. The casebook field remap from v1 codes (D3↔D4 swap, D5→D3) ships in the corresponding casebook update.

**v2.0 — May 2026** *(superseded by v2.1; never adopted standalone)*
- Drafted in `v2_research/01_LENS_revised_competencies_and_CLOs.md`. Renamed D2 → Learning Engineering Design, D4 → Context & Domain Fluency, D5 → Emerging Systems & Futures. Added the 7 subobjectives above (originally framed as "new CLOs" — refactored to subobjective level in v2.1 since they're sub-CLO-grain). Reframed decision-grade evidence.

**v1 — March 2026** *(initial)*
- Five competencies: Systems Analysis · Iterative Development · Test and Evaluation · Navigating Sociotechnical Constraints · Machine Teaming and Adaptation. Subobjectives 1.1–5.4. Prior prose retrievable via `git log --follow lens_program/1_LENS_Five_Competencies.md`.
