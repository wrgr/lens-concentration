# LENS / Capability Matters — co-located project repo

The casebook, the program documentation, and the active research and revision work co-located in one repo so they stay in sync.

## Start here

The shipping artefacts sit under `products/`, split by carrier: `products/digital/` for the on-screen PDFs and `products/print/` for the local / Lulu-bound interiors and their cover wraps. Everything else — Typst sources, planning notes, the canonical program docs of record, the v2 research backbone — lives in `casebook/`, `lens_program/`, and `v2_research/` as described below.

**Six deliverables, one Typst source.** Each is one version of the material rendered for one real destination — screen, home printer, or Lulu — so there are no near-duplicate "versions" to keep in sync. See [Build & versions](#build--versions) for why this is the whole set.

| File | What it is | Read it if you want… |
|---|---|---|
| **[`products/digital/capability-matters-digital.pdf`](products/digital/capability-matters-digital.pdf)** | The casebook **main volume**, digital — 48 selected cases, 277 pp, 8 × 10, colour on cream | the readable book: the seven-part argument with a curated cut spanning domains, modes, and evidence tiers |
| **[`products/digital/capability-matters-complete.pdf`](products/digital/capability-matters-complete.pdf)** | The **complete standalone edition** — all 205 cases, 908 pp, 8 × 10, colour on cream, global numbering | the entire corpus at full depth in one file; every gap in the printed sequence is here |
| **[`products/digital/capability-matters-lens-companion.pdf`](products/digital/capability-matters-lens-companion.pdf)** | LENS Companion — 43 pp, 8 × 10, white digital | the framework, end-to-end: the five v2.1 LENS competencies, the LEOs and course mapping, the induced ↔ canonical crosswalk, and the literal text of the `lens_program/` canonical docs (Docs 1–6). Travels with advisory boards, recruiting, prospective students. |
| **[`products/digital/capability-matters-validation-audit.pdf`](products/digital/capability-matters-validation-audit.pdf)** | Validation & Audit tracker — 75 pp, 8 × 10, white digital | the audit surface: every case by primary domain, every case by LENS course, and the full per-case references appendix with a *Retrieved from:* line per source. The verification-track companion to `casebook/verification-log.md`. |
| **[`products/print/capability-matters-print.pdf`](products/print/capability-matters-print.pdf)** + **[`products/print/cover-print.pdf`](products/print/cover-print.pdf)** | The **main volume**, Lulu print interior + cover wrap — 280 pp, 8 × 10, grayscale (black on white), 3 mm bleed; cover spine 17.39 mm | to send to Lulu for the bound first edition |
| **[`products/print/capability-matters-local-print.pdf`](products/print/capability-matters-local-print.pdf)** | The **local-print copy** — black-on-white main-volume interior with colour covers, every 8 × 10 page centered at 100% on US Letter, 279 pp | to print the book yourself on a home / office printer: reasonable margins, text size and layout exactly those of the 8 × 10 book |

The casebook makes the case; the LENS Companion is the orientation set someone reads to understand what LENS is; the Validation & Audit doc is the verification surface a reviewer or auditor works through. All six reproduce from one Typst source via `bash casebook/scripts/build.sh`, which mirrors exactly these files into `products/`. The build's only non-shipping intermediate (a split-format cover, needed to attach the colour covers to the local-print copy) stays inside `casebook/build/`.

## Build & versions

We deliberately keep **one version of the material per real destination** — not one per format knob. The material exists in two cuts (the 48-case printed **main volume** and the 205-case **complete standalone edition**), and the main volume is rendered for the three ways it actually gets used:

- **Read on screen** → `capability-matters-digital.pdf` (colour on cream, 8 × 10).
- **Printed at home / office** → `capability-matters-local-print.pdf` (black-on-white interior, colour covers, centered on US Letter).
- **Printed by Lulu** → `capability-matters-print.pdf` + `cover-print.pdf` (grayscale interior with bleed + the wrap).

Add the **complete standalone** (everything, for reference/distribution) and the two white-paper concept/audit documents — the **LENS Companion** and the **Validation & Audit** tracker — and that is the whole set. `products/print/` interiors are black on white (covers stay in colour); `products/digital/` are the on-screen PDFs (the main volume on cream).

This replaced an earlier pipeline that emitted ~18 artefacts — the main volume in five carriers, a separate digital supplement, a whole US-Letter / Half-Letter "summary booklet" line, plus assorted proof editions and split covers. Those were near-duplicate renders of the same content that drifted out of sync and were confusing to choose among. Retired in the simplification: the standalone **digital supplement** (its cases now reach readers through the complete standalone edition), the entire **summary-booklet line** (`overview` / `overview-half` and their covers), the **8 × 10 with-covers preview** and the **colour US-Letter home-print** edition (both superseded by the black-on-white local-print copy), and the standalone office **proof** (the local-print copy is the review artefact). To re-cut which cases sit in the printed main volume, edit the slug list in `casebook/lib/selection.typ`.

## Three anchor systems

Each case is tracked under three parallel taxonomies (per CLAUDE.md):

- **Induced competency framework** (8 competencies, 32 sub-competencies in `casebook/competencies.md`) — bottom-up induction from the v1 cases. Numbered `1.1` through `8.4`. The analytic scaffold.
- **Canonical LENS framework** (5 competencies in `lens_program/1_LENS_Five_Competencies.md`, v2.6) — Systems Analysis (D1) · Iterative Development (D2) · **Human-System Collaboration (D3)** · Data, Measurement, and Evaluation (D4) · Navigating Sociotechnical Constraints (D5). Plus six canonical Problem Types (PT1–6). The curriculum of record.
- **LEOs** (`lens_program/2_*.md`, v2.9) — five LEOs, one per domain, with the v2-named subobjectives (gap attribution at 4.2; delegation with revocation at 3.3; judgment under inadequate evidence at 4.4; fairness beyond omission at 4.6; collaboration measurement at 3.4; governance-objection diagnostic at 5.7 (moved from 1.5 in doc 1 v2.6); narrate/defend iteration at 2.5; cross-regime governance at 5.6). The course-mapping anchor.

The induced 8 fold cleanly into the canonical 5 (D2 has no induced counterpart — the iteration *method* is threaded through cases rather than producing its own cluster). The casebook records all three anchors on every v2 case; the LENS Companion (below) makes the crosswalks explicit.

## Current state — print-ready, June 2026

The first edition is structurally complete and reproduces from source.

**Casebook** — 205 numbered cases organised topically (14 are quarantined from every build — see [`casebook/QUARANTINE.md`](casebook/QUARANTINE.md) — so **191 are active**; the numbering keeps its gaps), cut into a printed **main volume** (48 selected cases; registry in `casebook/lib/selection.typ`) and a **complete standalone edition** (all active cases; global numbering shared, matrix marks the out-of-volume cases with °), both from the same source. Full corpus in seven parts (Healthcare & Patient Safety; Education, Training & the Learning Workforce; Aviation & Aerospace; Defense & National Security — the middle part; Industry, Energy & Enterprise Systems; Disaster Prevention & Recovery, read pre → post; Algorithms, Governance & Public Systems), each split into What Fails / What Works + frontier — 14 chapters, closing framing case last. All anchored to v2.1; all cross-references in range. `bash casebook/scripts/check-cases.sh` reports 191 converted cases, 0 failures.

**LENS Companion** — `capability-matters-lens-companion.pdf`, 43 pp, 8 × 10 white digital. The concept-facing companion: the v2.1 five competencies, the LEOs and the course mapping, the induced-→-canonical crosswalk, and the three-anchor convention, plus the literal text of the `lens_program/` source-of-record docs (Docs 1–6) inlined verbatim. Sized to be read end-to-end; designed to travel with advisory boards, recruiting conversations, and prospective students. Built from the casebook source via `--input view=companion`.

**Validation & Audit** — `capability-matters-validation-audit.pdf`, 75 pp, 8 × 10 white digital. The audit-facing companion: cases by primary domain, cases by LENS course, and the full per-case references appendix with a *Retrieved from:* line per source. Pairs with `casebook/verification-log.md` to drive the per-case content-read pass that closes the verification track. Built from the same casebook source.

**All outputs from one source** — `bash casebook/scripts/build.sh` builds these six and mirrors them into `products/`; the only non-shipping intermediate (the split cover) stays under `casebook/build/`. See [Build & versions](#build--versions) for the rationale.

| Output | Carrier | Size | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `capability-matters-print.pdf` | print | 8 × 10, grayscale, 3 mm bleed | 280 | main volume — Lulu production interior |
| `cover-print.pdf` | print | 8 × 10 wrap | — | main-volume Lulu cover, spine 17.39 mm |
| `capability-matters-local-print.pdf` | print | US Letter, grayscale interior + colour covers | 279 | main volume — print at home / office |
| `capability-matters-digital.pdf` | digital | 8 × 10, colour, cream | 277 | main volume — screen / PDF |
| `capability-matters-complete.pdf` | digital | 8 × 10, colour, cream | 908 | complete standalone — all 205 cases |
| `capability-matters-lens-companion.pdf` | digital | 8 × 10, white | 50 | concept companion — concentration docs + crosswalks + canonical lens_program/ docs |
| `capability-matters-validation-audit.pdf` | digital | 8 × 10, white | 102 | audit tracker — indexes + per-case references |

**v2.1 framework adoption (June 2026)** — Per program-owner sign-off:
- D3 reorder + rename: what was D5 *Machine Teaming and Adaptation* is broadened to **Human-System Collaboration** and moved to position 3. T&E moves to D4; Sociotechnical Constraints to D5. The order reads as the flywheel: see → build → integrate humans → measure → deploy.
- 7 new named subobjectives (1.5, 2.5, 3.3, 3.4, 4.4, 4.6, 5.6) plus 4.2 renamed *gap attribution* and decision-grade evidence reframed as judgment under irreducible uncertainty.
- Casebook lens/LEO fields and `lens-approach` prose remapped to v2.1 across all cases.

**Editorial passes folded in** — Stage-3 anchoring of 62 previously-unanchored v1 cases (54 STRONG / 8 SOLID, decisions logged in `AUDIT.md`); 10-chapter restructure with single atomic renumber; three wrong-placement fixes (TMI, Vincennes, Texas City BP) caught during Q&A; automated references validation across ~951 references (10 ISSUE-class items all resolved in source).

**Verification log handoff** — `casebook/verification-log.md` is a 205-row table with six of seven check columns auto pre-filled. The seventh (*conclusions reasonable*) is intentionally empty pending a human case-by-case content read. The rubric defines a 5–15 min two-pass review workflow (quality, then content) with a worked example on Case 1. `bash casebook/scripts/verification-status.sh` parses the log and prints overall + per-chapter progress + open issues.

## How to find the next thing to do

- **For the case-by-case verification pass** (the only remaining quality gate before press): `casebook/verification-log.md` for the rubric and the table; `casebook/scripts/verification-status.sh` for progress.
- **For the pre-press handoff to Lulu**: upload `capability-matters-print.pdf` (280 pp) and `cover-print.pdf` (spine 17.39 mm); Lulu may quote-back ±1 mm — the spine-override flag in `casebook/scripts/build.sh` handles a re-cut.
- **For program-doc updates** (LEOs, course mapping, recruiting copy): `lens_program/` is the source of record; change logs are inline at the bottom of docs 1 and 2.
- **For course development** (Canvas module pages, assignments, rubrics, lecture decks, ID meeting notes): not here. That work lives in the private companion repo `wrgr/lens-private` (`courses/LEN01/`), which carries the SOE/LDT authoring templates. Only the program-guiding tier — docs 1 and 2, the syllabus of record, the CPC filing, decision records — lands in `lens_program/` here.
- **For framework rationale or research backbone**: `v2_research/` is preserved for traceability; the proposal (`01_*`) carries an ADOPTED status header naming the two adoption-time refinements.

## Working conventions

See `CLAUDE.md` for the binding rules. Key conventions:

- Develop on a topic branch under `claude/` (e.g. `claude/<short-topic-slug>`); push and open a PR. The editor decides when to merge to `main`. Don't push directly to `main`.
- Every case carries `scale:` (`big` | `small`), `evidence-source:` (`investigation` | `peer-reviewed` | `program-report` | `practitioner` | `dissertation` | `journalism`), and three anchors (induced, lens, LEO).
- COI / evidence-tier / hedge flags from the v2 build list survive into print: gold-bordered "Disclosure" block for COI cases (CIRCUIT, BRAIN, Johnson, JIGSAWS); blue-bordered "Evidence tier" block for journalism-tier / preprint-tier / practice-synthesis-tier / thesis-pending / internal-pm.
- Don't pad citations. Three real sources beat eight stretched ones. (The references validation pass came in at 1.05% ISSUE rate; the bar is the bar.)
- Don't edit `lens_program/.docx` files directly — they need a program-owner round-trip from the `.md`. The `.md` is the working canonical between round-trips.
